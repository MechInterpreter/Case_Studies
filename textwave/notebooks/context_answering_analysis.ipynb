      "Chunk 2: 'He was defeated for re-election in the \"Revolution of 1800\" by Thomas Jefferson. Adams was also the first President to reside in the newly built White House in Washington, D.C., which was completed in 1800.'\n",
      "Chunk 3: 'Adams, a sponsor of the American Revolution in Massachusetts, was a driving force for independence in 1776; Jefferson called him the \"Colossus of Independence\". He represented the Continental Congress in Europe.'\n",
      "Chunk 4: 'He was a major negotiator of the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain, and chiefly responsible for obtaining the loans from the Amsterdam money market necessary for the conduct of the Revolution. His prestige secured his two elections as Washington's Vice President and his election to succeed him.'\n",
      "Chunk 5: 'As President, he was frustrated by battles inside his own Federalist party against a faction led by Alexander Hamilton, but he broke with them to avert a major conflict with France in 1798, during the Quasi-War crisis. He became the founder of an important family of politicians, diplomats and historians, and in recent years his reputation has improved.'\n",
      "Chunk 6: 'Birthplace of John Adams, Quincy, Massachusetts. John Adams was the oldest of three brothers, born on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735 by the Old Style, Julian calendar), in Braintree, Massachusetts, though in an area which became part of Quincy, Massachusetts in 1792.'\n",
      "Chunk 7: 'His birthplace is now part of Adams National Historical Park. His father, a farmer and a Deacon, also named John (1690-1761), was a fourth-generation descendant of Henry Adams, who immigrated from Barton St David, Somerset, England, to Massachusetts Bay Colony in about 1636, from a Welsh male line called Ap Adam.'\n",

      "Chunk 10: 'After graduating in 1755, he taught school for a few years in Worcester, allowing himself time to think about his career choice. After much reflection, he decided to become a lawyer, and studied law in the office of James Putnam, a prominent lawyer in Worcester.'\n",
      "Chunk 11: 'In 1758, he was admitted to the bar. From an early age, he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men.'\n",
      "Chunk 12: 'These litter his diary. He put the skill to good use as a lawyer, often recording cases he observed so that he could study and reflect upon them.'\n",
      "Chunk 13: 'His report of the 1761 argument of James Otis in the superior court of Massachusetts as to the legality of Writs of Assistance is a good example. Otis’s argument inspired Adams with zeal for the cause of the American colonies.'\n",
      "Chunk 14: 'Ferling (1992) ch 2 In 1764, Adams married Abigail Smith (1744–1818), the daughter of a Congregational minister,Rev. William Smith, at Weymouth, Massachusetts.'\n",
      "Chunk 15: 'Their children were Abigail (1765-1813); future president John Quincy (1767-1848); Susanna (1768–1770); Charles (1770-1800); Thomas Boylston (1772-1832); and Elizabeth (1775) who was stillborn. Adams was not a popular leader like his second cousin, Samuel Adams; instead, his influence emerged through his work as a constitutional lawyer and his intense analysis of historical examples, Ferling (1992) p 117 together with his thorough knowledge of the law and his dedication to the principles of republicanism.'\n",
      "Chunk 16: 'Adams often found his inborn contentiousness to be a restraint in his political career. Adams wanted to secure approval from the people, and he saw his chance in the British/colonial conflict.'\n",
      "Chunk 17: 'He became well known for his essays and energetic resolutions against British taxation and regulation. In 1774 Massachusetts sent him to the Continental Congress.'\n",
      "Chunk 18: 'In 1775 war broke out between the colonies and Great Britain. Adams was one of the first few delegates to recognize that a compromise with the British was pointless.'\n",
      "Chunk 19: 'In 1776 he worked hard to break away from Britain by using a formal declaration of independence. On July 2, 1776 Congress voted for the resolution, \"these colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states.\"'\n",
      "Chunk 20: 'Two days later, they passed the Declaration of Independence. johna.jpg Adams first rose to prominence as an opponent of the Stamp Act of 1765.'\n",
      "Chunk 21: 'In that year, he drafted the instructions which were sent by the inhabitants of Braintree to its representatives in the Massachusetts legislature, and which served as a model for other towns to draw up instructions to their representatives. In August 1765, he anonymously contributed four notable articles to the Boston Gazette (republished in The London Chronicle in 1768 as True Sentiments of America and also known as A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law).'\n",
      "Chunk 22: 'In the letter he suggested that there was a connection between the Protestant ideas that Adams' Puritan ancestors brought to New England and the ideas that suggested they resist the Stamp Act. In the former he explained that the opposition of the colonies to the Stamp Act was because the Stamp Act deprived the American colonists of two basic rights guaranteed to all Englishmen, and which all free men deserved: rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried only by a jury of one's peers.'\n",
      "Chunk 23: 'The \"Braintree Instructions\" were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties, while the Dissertation was an essay in political education. In December 1765, he delivered a speech before the governor and council in which he pronounced the Stamp Act invalid on the ground that Massachusetts, being without representation in Parliament, had not assented to it.'\n",
      "Chunk 24: 'Ferling (1992) pp 53-63 In 1770, a street confrontation resulted in British soldiers killing four civilians in what became known as the Boston Massacre. The soldiers involved, who were arrested on criminal charges, had trouble finding legal counsel.'\n",
      "Chunk 25: 'Finally, they asked Adams to defend them. Although he feared it would hurt his reputation, he agreed.'\n",
      "Chunk 26: 'One of the soldiers, Captain Thomas Preston gave Adams a symbolic \"single guinea\" as a retaining fee, Chinard, John Adams, 58-60 the only fee he received in the case. Or, as stated in the biography of John Adams by David McCullough, Adams received nothing more than a retainer of eighteen guineas.'\n",
      "Chunk 27: 'McCullough, John Adams, pg. 66 Six of the soldiers were acquitted.'\n",
      "Chunk 28: 'Two who had fired directly into the crowd were charged with murder but were convicted only of manslaughter. Despite his previous misgivings, Adams was elected to the Massachusetts General Court (the colonial legislature) in June of 1770, while still in preparation for the trial.'\n",
      "Chunk 29: 'In 1772, Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson announced that he and his judges would no longer need their salaries paid by the Massachusetts legislature, because the Crown would henceforth assume payment drawn from customs revenues. Boston radicals protested and asked Adams to explain their objections.'\n",
      "Chunk 30: 'In \"Two Replies of the Massachusetts House of Representatives to Governor Hutchinson\" Adams argued that the colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament. Their original charter was with the person of the king and their allegiance was only to him.'\n",
      "Chunk 31: 'If a workable line could not be drawn between parliamentary sovereignty and the total independence of the colonies, he continued, the colonies would have no other choice but to choose independence. In Novanglus; or, A History of the Dispute with America, From Its Origin, in 1754, to the Present Time Adams attacked some essays by Daniel Leonard that defended Hutchinson's arguments for the absolute authority of Parliament over the colonies.'\n",
      "Chunk 32: 'In Novanglus Adams gave a point-by-point refutation of Leonard's essays, and then provided one of the most extensive and learned arguments made by the colonists against British imperial policy. It was a systematic attempt by Adams to describe the origins, nature, and jurisdiction of the unwritten British constitution.'\n",
      "Chunk 33: 'Adams used his wide knowledge of English and colonial legal history to show the provincial legislatures were fully sovereign over their own internal affairs, and that the colonies were connected to Great Britain only through the King. Massachusetts sent Adams to the first and second Continental Congresses in 1774 and from 1775 to 1778.'\n",
      "Chunk 34: 'In 1775 he was also appointed the chief judge of the Massachusetts Superior Court. In June 1775, with a view of promoting the union of the colonies, he nominated George Washington of Virginia as commander-in-chief of the army then assembled around Boston.'\n",
      "Chunk 35: 'His influence in Congress was great, and almost from the beginning, he sought permanent separation from Britain. On October 5, 1775, Congress created the first of a series of committees to study naval matters.'\n",
      "Chunk 36: 'On May 15, 1776 the Continental Congress, in response to escalating hostilities which had climaxed a year prior at Lexington and Concord, urged that the states begin constructing their own constitutions. John Trumbull's famous painting depicts the five-man drafting committee presenting their work to the Congress.'\n",
      "Chunk 37: 'John Adams is standing in the center of the painting. Today, the Declaration of Independence is remembered as the great revolutionary act, but Adams and most of his contemporaries saw the Declaration as a mere formality.'\n",
      "Chunk 38: 'The resolution to draft independent constitutions was, as Adams put it, \"independence itself.\" Ferling (1992) ch 8 p 146 Over the next decade, Americans from every state gathered and deliberated on new governing documents.'\n",
      "Chunk 39: 'As radical as it was to actually write constitutions (prior convention suggested that a society's form of government needn't be codified, nor should its organic law be written down in a single document), what was equally radical was the nature of American political thought as the summer of 1776 dawned. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (1993) At that time several Congressmen turned to Adams for advice about framing new governments.'\n",
      "Chunk 40: 'Adams tired of repeating the same thing, and published the pamphlet Thoughts on Government (1776), which was subsequently influential in the writing of many state constitutions. Many historians argue that Thoughts on Government should be read as an articulation of the classical theory of mixed government.'\n",
      "Chunk 41: 'Adams contended that social classes exist in every political society, and that a good government must accept that reality. For centuries, dating back to Aristotle, a mixed regime balancing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, or the monarch, nobles, and people was required to preserve order and liberty.'\n",
      "Chunk 42: 'Ferling (1992) pp 155-7, 213-5 Using the tools of Republicanism in the United States the patriots believed it was corrupt and nefarious aristocrats, in the English Parliament and stationed in America, who were guilty of the British assault on American liberty. Unlike others, Adams thought that the definition of a republic had to do with its ends, rather than its means.'\n",
      "Chunk 43: 'He wrote in Thoughts on Government, \"there is no good government but what is republican. That the only valuable part of the British constitution is so; because the very definition of a republic is 'an empire of laws, and not of men.'\"'\n",
      "Chunk 44: 'Thoughts on Government defended bicameralism, for \"a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies, and frailties of an individual.\" Thoughts on Government, Works of John Adams, IV:195 He also suggested that the executive should be independent, as should the judiciary.'\n",
      "Chunk 45: 'Thoughts on Government' was enormously influential and was referenced as an authority in every state-constitution writing hall. On June 7, 1776, Adams seconded the resolution introduced by Richard Henry Lee that \"these colonies are, and of a right ought to be, free and independent states,\" acting as champion of these resolutions before the Congress until their adoption on July 2, 1776.'\n",
      "Chunk 46: 'Ferling (1992) ch 8. An 1813 letter by Adams, in which he said that one-third of the people supported the revolution, refers to the French revolution in the 1790s.'\n",
      "Chunk 47: 'He was appointed on a committee with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman, to draft a Declaration of Independence. Although that document was largely drafted by Jefferson, Adams occupied the foremost place in the debate on its adoption.'\n",
      "Chunk 48: 'He deferred the writing to Jefferson believing it would be better received having been written by him. Adams believed Jefferson wrote profoundly better than any man in Congress, and he himself was \"obnoxious and disliked.\"'\n",
      "Chunk 49: 'Many years later, Jefferson hailed Adams as, \"The Colossus of that Congress the great pillar of support to the Declaration of Independence, and its ablest advocate and champion on the floor of the House.\" Lipscomb & Bergh, eds.'\n",
      "Chunk 50: 'Writings of Thomas Jefferson (1903), vol 13, p xxiv In 1777, Adams resigned his seat on the Massachusetts Superior Court to serve as the head of the Board of War and Ordinance, as well as many other important committees. Marquis 1607-1896 John Adams, as depicted on a two-cent American president postage stamp.'\n",
      "Chunk 51: 'Congress chose Adams to represent the fledgling union in Europe in 1777, and again in 1779. On the second trip, he was appointed as minister plenipotentiary charged with the mission of negotiating a treaty of peace and a treaty of commerce with Great Britain; he went to Europe in September 1779.'\n",
      "Chunk 52: 'The French government, however, did not approve of Adams’s appointment and subsequently, on the insistence of the French foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay and Henry Laurens were appointed to cooperate with Adams. In the event Jay, Adams and Franklin played the major part in the negotiations.'\n",
      "Chunk 53: 'Overruling Franklin, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France; instead, they dealt directly with the British commissioners. Ferling (1992) ch 11-12 Throughout the negotiations, Adams was especially determined that the right of the United States to the fisheries along the Atlantic coast should be recognized.'\n",
      "Chunk 54: 'The American negotiators were able to secure a favorable treaty, which gave Americans ownership of all lands east of the Mississippi, except Florida, which was transferred to Spain as its reward. The treaty was signed on November 30, 1782.'\n",
      "Chunk 55: 'After these negotiations began, Adams had spent some time as the ambassador in the Netherlands, then the only other well-functioning Republic in the world. In July 1780, he had been authorized to execute the duties previously assigned to Laurens.'\n",
      "Chunk 56: 'With the aid of the Dutch patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states had been the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition, in 1778).'\n",
      "Chunk 57: 'During this visit, he also negotiated a loan of five million guilders. It was floated by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink.'\n",
      "Chunk 58: 'Up till 1794 a total of eleven loans were granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders. In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce, the second such treaty between the United States and a foreign power (after the 1778 treaty with France).'\n",
      "Chunk 59: 'The house that Adams purchased during this stay in The Netherlands became the first American embassy on foreign soil anywhere in the world. In 1785, John Adams was appointed the first American minister to the Court of St. James's (that is, ambassador to Great Britain).'\n",
      "Chunk 60: 'When he was presented to his former sovereign, George III, the King intimated that he was aware of Adams's lack of confidence in the French government. Adams admitted this, stating: \"I must avow to your Majesty that I have no attachment but to my own country.” Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain referred to this episode in July 7, 1976 at the White House.'\n",
      "Chunk 61: 'She said, \"John Adams, America's first Ambassador, said to my ancestor, King George III, that it was his desire to help with the restoration of \"the old good nature and the old good humor between our peoples.\" That restoration has long been made, and the links of language, tradition, and personal contact have maintained it.\"'\n",
      "Chunk 62: 'See /ref> Massachusetts's new constitution, ratified in 1780 and written largely by Adams himself, structured its government most closely on his views of politics and society. Ronald M. Peters.'\n",
      "Chunk 63: 'The Massachusetts Constitution of 1780: A Social Compact (1978) p 13 says Adams was its \"principal architect.\" It was the first constitution written by a special committee and ratified by the people.'\n",
      "Chunk 64: 'It was also the first to feature a bicameral legislature, a clear and distinct executive with a partial (2/3) veto (although he was restrained by an executive council), and a distinct judicial branch. While in London, Adams published a work entitled A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States (1787).'\n",
      "Chunk 65: 'In it he repudiated the views of Turgot and other European writers as to the viciousness of the framework of state governments. Turgot argued that countries that lacked aristocracies needn't have bicameral legislatures.'\n",
      "Chunk 66: 'He thought that republican governments feature “all authorities into one center, that of the nation.” Turgot to Richard Price, March 22, 1778, in Works of John Adams, IV:279 In the book, Adams suggested that \"the rich, the well-born and the able\" should be set apart from other men in a senate--that would prevent them from dominating the lower house. Wood (2006) has maintained that Adams had become intellectually irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified.'\n",
      "Chunk 67: 'By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a decade of vigorous and searching debate as well as shaping experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical conception of politics which understood government as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new conception of popular sovereignty now saw the people-at-large as the sole possessors of power in the realm.'\n",
      "Chunk 68: 'All agents of the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited period of time. Adams had completely missed this concept and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics.'\n",
      "Chunk 69: 'Wood, Revolutionary Characters: What Made the Founders Different (2006) pp 173-202; see also Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (1993). Yet Wood overlooks Adams' peculiar definition of the term \"republic,\" and his support for a constitution ratified by the people.'\n",
      "Chunk 70: 'Thompson,1999 He also underplays Adams' belief in checks and balances. \"Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest,” Adams wrote.'\n",
      "Chunk 71: 'Works of John Adams, IV:557 Adams did as much as anyone to put the idea of \"checks and balances\" on the intellectual map. Adams never bought a slave and declined on principle to employ slave labor.'\n",
      "Chunk 72: 'Littlefield, Daniel C. \"John Jay, the Revolutionary Generation, and Slavery.\" New York History 2000 81(1): p 91-132.'\n",
      "Chunk 73: 'ISSN 0146-437X Abigail Adams opposed slavery and employed free blacks in preference to her father's two domestic slaves. He spoke out against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, opposed use of black soldiers in the Revolution, and tried to keep the issue out of national politics.'\n",
      "Chunk 74: 'Ferling (1992) pp 172-3 John Adams, portrait by John Trumbull. While Washington was the unanimous choice for president, Adams came in second in the electoral college and became Vice President in the presidential election of 1789.'\n",
      "Chunk 75: 'He played a minor role in the politics of the early 1790s and was reelected in 1792. Washington never asked Adams for input on policy and legal issues.'\n",
      "Chunk 76: 'Ferling (1992) ch 15 One of the best known Adams quotes concluded of the institution of the Vice Presidency: This is the most unimportant position human ever made. \"Wizje Stanów Zjednoczonych w Pismach Ojców Założycieli\", Warsaw, 1976 His main task while in this office was presiding over Senate.'\n",
      "Chunk 77: 'Most Vice Presidents after him were not regarded as powerful or significant members of Presidential administrations, with some exceptions (such as Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, Walter Mondale, Al Gore or Dick Cheney, who were regarded as influential members of their President's teams). In the first year of Washington's administration, Adams became deeply involved in a month-long Senate controversy over what the official title of the President would be, favoring grandiose titles such as \"His Majesty the President\" or \"His High Mightiness\" over the simple \"President of the United States\" that won the issue.'\n",
      "Chunk 78: 'The pomposity of Adams's stance, and his being overweight, led to the nickname \"His Rotundity.\" As president of the Senate, Adams cast 31 tie-breaking votes—a record that only John C. Calhoun came close to tying, with 28.'\n",
      "Chunk 79: 'Ferling (1992) p 311 His votes protected the president's sole authority over the removal of appointees and influenced the location of the national capital. On at least one occasion, he persuaded senators to vote against legislation that he opposed, and he frequently lectured the Senate on procedural and policy matters.'\n",
      "Chunk 80: 'Adams's political views and his active role in the Senate made him a natural target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, as a result of a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters, he began to exercise more restraint.'\n",
      "Chunk 81: 'When the two political parties formed, he joined the Federalist Party, but never got on well with its dominant leader Alexander Hamilton. Because of Adams's seniority and the need for a northern president, he was elected as the Federalist nominee for president in 1796, over Thomas Jefferson, the leader of the opposition Democratic-Republican Party.'\n",
      "Chunk 82: 'His success was due to peace and prosperity; Washington and Hamilton had averted war with Britain by the Jay Treaty of 1795. Ferling (1992) pp 316-32 Adams' two terms as Vice President were frustrating experiences for a man of his vigor, intellect, and vanity.'\n",
      "Chunk 83: 'He complained to his wife Abigail, \"My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.\" During the presidential campaign of 1796 Adams was the presidential candidate of the Federalist Party and Thomas Pinckney, the Governor of South Carolina, his running mate.'\n",
      "Chunk 84: 'The federalists wanted Adams as their presidential candidate to crush Thomas Jefferson's bid. Most federalists would have preferred Hamilton to be a candidate.'\n",
      "Chunk 85: 'Although Hamilton and his followers supported Adams, they also held a grudge against him. They did consider him to be the lesser of the two evils.'\n",
      "Chunk 86: 'However, they thought Adams lacked the seriousness and popularity that had caused Washington to be successful, and also feared that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable, and stubborn to follow their directions. Adams' opponents were former Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, who was joined by Senator Aaron Burr of New York on the Democratic-Republican ticket.'\n",
      "Chunk 87: 'As was customary, Adams stayed in his home town of Quincy rather than actively campaign for the Presidency. He wanted to stay out of what he called the silly and wicked game.'\n",
      "Chunk 88: 'His party, however, campaigned for him, while the Republicans campaigned for Jefferson. It was expected that Adams would dominate the votes in New England, while Jefferson was expected to win in the Southern states.'\n",
      "Chunk 89: 'In the end, Adams won the election by a narrow margin of 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson (who became the vice president). When Adams entered office, he realized that he needed to protect Washington’s policy of staying out of the French and British war.'\n",
      "Chunk 90: 'Because the French helped secure American independence from Britain they had greater popularity with America. After the Jay treaty with Great Britain the French became angry and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British.'\n",
      "Chunk 91: 'In order for Adams to avoid war he sent a commission to negotiate an understanding with France. In case the negotiation did not work Adams urged the Congress to augment the navy and army.'\n",
      "Chunk 92: 'Presidential Dollar of John Adams As President Adams followed Washington's lead in making the presidency the example of republican values and stressing civic virtue, he was never implicated in any scandal. Some historians consider his worst mistake to be keeping the old cabinet, which was controlled by Hamilton, instead of installing his own people, confirming Adams's own admission he was a poor politician because he \"was unpractised in intrigues for power.\"'\n",
      "Chunk 93: 'Ferling (1992) ch 16, p 333. Yet, there are those historians who feel that Adams retention of Washington's cabinet was a statesman-like step to soothe worries about an orderly succession.'\n",
      "Chunk 94: 'As Adams himself explained, \"I had then no particular object of any of them.\" McCullough p 471 That would soon change.'\n",
      "Chunk 95: 'Adams's combative spirit did not always lend itself to presidential decorum, as Adams himself admitted in his old age: \"[As president] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed.'\n",

      "Chunk 31: 'His solution was to appease both northern and southern Whigs by calling for the enforcement of the fugitive slave law in the North, and enforcing in the South a law forbidding involvement in Cuba (for the sole purpose of adding it as a slave state).

      "Chunk 130: 'McClellan's delay irritated Lincoln, as did his insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign. McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison's Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort.'\n",
      "Chunk 131: 'McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint John Pope, a Republican, as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack.'\n",
      "Chunk 132: 'But Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. In response to his failure, Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux.'\n",

After the Union victory at Gettysburg, Meade's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to bring in a western general, Ulysses S. Grant.'\n",

      "Chunk 141: 'He had, however, limited success in motivating his commanders to adopt his strategies until late 1863, when he found a man who shared his vision of the war in Ulysses S. Grant.

In an attempt to capture the Mississippi River fortress of Vicksburg, Mississippi, Grant spent the winter of 1862 1863 conducting a series of operations to gain access to the city through the region's bayous.'\n",
      "Chunk 66: 'These attempts failed. However, his strategy to take Vicksburg in 1863 is considered one of the most masterful in military history.'\n",
      "Chunk 67: 'Grant marched his troops down the west bank of the Mississippi and crossed the river by using U.S. Navy ships that had run the guns at Vicksburg. There, he moved inland and in a daring move that defied conventional military principles cut loose from most of his supply lines.'\n",
      "Chunk 68: 'One of the enduring myths about Grant is that he dispensed with all of his supply lines and lived entirely off the land. This story was first propagated by former journalist Charles A. Dana and years later, Grant wrote the same in his memoirs.'\n",
      "Chunk 69: 'However, supply requisitions show that, while the men and animals of the Army of the Tennessee foraged for much of their food, staples such as coffee, salt, hardtack, ammunition, and medical supplies kept a large fleet of wagons moving inland from Grand Gulf throughout the campaign. This supply train was a target of Pemberton until Champion Hill.'\n",

Sherman in immediate command of all forces in the West and moved his headquarters to Virginia where he turned his attention to the long-frustrated Union effort to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia; his secondary objective was to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, but Grant knew that the latter would happen automatically once the former was accomplished. He devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the heart of the Confederacy from multiple directions: Grant, George G. Meade, and Benjamin Franklin Butler against Lee near Richmond; Franz Sigel in the Shenandoah Valley; Sherman to invade Georgia, defeat Joseph E. Johnston, and capture Atlanta; George Crook and William W. Averell to operate against railroad supply lines in West Virginia; and Nathaniel Banks to capture Mobile, Alabama.'\n",

Grant said of the battle in his memoirs \"I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.'\n",
      "Chunk 95: 'I might say the same thing of the assault of the 22nd of May, 1863, at Vicksburg. At Cold Harbor no advantage whatever was gained to compensate for the heavy loss we sustained.\"'\n",

There, Grant offered generous terms that did much to ease the tensions between the armies and preserve some semblance of Southern pride, which would be needed to reconcile the warring sides.'\n",
      "Chunk 106: 'Within a few weeks, the American Civil War was effectively over; minor actions would continue until Kirby Smith surrendered his forces in the Trans-Mississippi Department on June 2, 1865.

      "Chunk 109: 'The term accurately captures his tenacity, but it oversimplifies his considerable strategic and tactical capabilities. Although a master of combat by out-maneuvering his opponent (such as at Vicksburg and in the Overland Campaign against Lee), Grant was not afraid to order direct assaults, often when the Confederates were themselves launching offensives against him.'\n",
      "Chunk 110: 'Such tactics often resulted in heavy casualties for Grant's men, but they wore down the Confederate forces proportionately more and inflicted irreplaceable losses. Many in the North denounced Grant as a \"butcher\" in 1864, an accusation made both by Northern civilians appalled at the staggering number of casualties suffered by Union armies for what appeared to be negligible gains, and by Copperheads, Northern Democrats who either favored the Confederacy or simply wanted an end to the war, even at the cost of recognizing Southern independence.'\n",
      "Chunk 111: 'Grant persevered, refusing to withdraw as had his predecessors, and Lincoln, despite public outrage and pressure within the government, stuck by Grant, refusing to replace him. Although Grant lost battles in 1864, he won all his campaigns.'\n",

Johnson tried to use Grant to defeat the Radical Republicans by making Grant the Secretary of War in place of Edwin M. Stanton, whom he could not remove without the approval of Congress under the Tenure of Office Act.'\n",

Graff ed., The Presidents: A Reference History (2002) p 370 Wilson had to outmaneuver bankers and enemies of banks, North and South, Democrats and Republicans to secure passage of the Federal Reserve system in late 1913. [Link 1954 pp 43-53; Link 1956 pp 199-240] He took a plan that had been designed by conservative Republicans led by Nelson W. Aldrich and banker Paul M. Warburg and passed it.'\n",
      "Chunk 71: 'However, Wilson had to find a middle ground between those who supported the Aldrich Plan and those who opposed it, including the powerful agrarian wing of the party, led by William Jennings Bryan, which strenuously denounced banks and Wall Street. They wanted a government-owned central bank which could print paper money whenever Congress wanted.'\n",
      "Chunk 72: 'Wilson’s plan still allowed the large banks to have important influence, but Wilson went beyond the Aldrich plan and created a central board made up of persons appointed by the President and approved by Congress who would outnumber the board members who were bankers. Moreover, Wilson convinced Bryan’s supporters that because Federal Reserve notes were obligations of the government, the plan fit their demands.'\n",
      "Chunk 73: 'Wilson’s plan also decentralized the Federal Reserve system into 12 districts. This was designed to weaken the influence of the powerful New York banks, a key demand of Bryan’s allies in the South and West.'\n",
      "Chunk 74: 'This decentralization was a key factor in winning the support of Congressman Carter Glass (D-VA) although he objected to making paper currency a federal obligation. Glass was one of the leaders of the currency reformers in the U.S. House and without his support, any plan was doomed to fail.'\n",
      "Chunk 75: 'The final plan passed, in December 1913, despite opposition by bankers, who felt it gave too much control to Washington, and by some reformers, who felt it allowed bankers to maintain too much power. Wilson named Warburg and other prominent bankers to direct the new system.'\n",
      "Chunk 76: 'Despite the reformers' hopes, the New York branch dominated the Fed and thus power remained in Wall Street. The new system began operations in 1915 and played a major role in financing the Allied and American war efforts.'\n",
      "Chunk 77: 'Wilson's early views on international affairs and trade were stated in his Columbia University lectures of April 1907 where he said: \"Since trade ignores national boundaries and the manufacturer insists on having the world as a market, the flag of his nation must follow him, and the doors of the nations which are closed must be battered down…Concessions obtained by financiers must be safeguarded by ministers of state, even if the sovereignty of unwilling nations be outraged in the process. Colonies must be obtained or planted, in order that no useful corner of the world may be overlooked or left unused\".'\n",

      "Chunk 84: 'Wilson tried to bring labor and management together, but when management refused he had Congress pass the \"Adamson Act\" in September 1916, which avoided the strike by imposing an 8-hour work day in the industry (at the same pay as before). It helped Wilson gain union support for his reelection; the act was approved by the Supreme Court.'\n",
      "Chunk 85: 'Wilson uses tariff, currency and anti-trust laws to prime the pump and get the economy working in a 1913 political cartoon Wilson broke with the \"big-lawsuit\" tradition of his predecessors Taft and Roosevelt as \"Trustbusters\", finding a new approach to encouraging competition through the Federal Trade Commission, which stopped \"unfair\" trade practices. In addition, he pushed through Congress the Clayton Antitrust Act making certain business practices illegal (such as price discrimination, agreements forbidding retailers from handling other companies’ products, and directorates and agreements to control other companies).'\n",
      "Chunk 86: 'The power of this legislation was greater than previous anti-trust laws, because individual officers of corporations could be held responsible if their companies violated the laws. More importantly, the new laws set out clear guidelines that corporations could follow, a dramatic improvement over the previous uncertainties.'\n",
      "Chunk 87: 'This law was considered the \"Magna Carta\" of labor by Samuel Gompers because it ended union liability antitrust laws. In 1916, under threat of a national railroad strike, he approved legislation that increased wages and cut working hours of railroad employees; there was no strike.'\n",
      "Chunk 88: 'Wilson spent 1914 through the beginning of 1917 trying to keep America out of the war in Europe. He offered to be a mediator, but neither the Allies nor the Central Powers took his requests seriously.'\n",
      "Chunk 89: 'Republicans, led by Theodore Roosevelt, strongly criticized Wilson’s refusal to build up the U.S. Army in anticipation of the threat of war. Wilson won the support of the U.S. peace element by arguing that an army buildup would provoke war.'\n",
      "Chunk 90: 'He vigorously protested Germany’s use of submarines as illegal, causing his Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan to resign in protest in 1915. While German submarines were sinking allied ships, Britain had declared a blockade of Germany, preventing neutral shipping carrying “contraband” goods to Germany.'\n",
      "Chunk 91: 'Wilson protested this violation of neutral rights by London. However, his protests to the British were not viewed as being as forceful as those he directed towards Germany.'\n",
      "Chunk 92: 'This reflects the fact that while Britain was violating international law towards neutral shipping by mining international harbors and killing sailors (including Americans), their violations were not direct attacks on the shipping of Americans or other neutrals, while German submarine warfare directly targeted shipping that benefited their enemies, neutral or not, violating international law and resulting in visible American deaths. Renominated in 1916, Wilson's major campaign slogan was \"He kept us out of the war\" referring to his administration's avoiding open conflict with Germany or Mexico while maintaining a firm national policy.'\n",
      "Chunk 93: 'Wilson, however, never promised to keep out of war regardless of provocation. In his acceptance speech on September 2, 1916, Wilson pointedly warned Germany that submarine warfare that took American lives would not be tolerated: Wilson narrowly won the election, defeating Republican candidate Charles Evans Hughes.'\n",
      "Chunk 94: 'As governor of New York from 1907-1910, Hughes had a progressive record strikingly similar to Wilson's as governor of New Jersey. Theodore Roosevelt would comment that the only thing different between Hughes and Wilson was a shave.'\n",
      "Chunk 95: 'However, Hughes had to try to hold together a coalition of conservative Taft supporters and progressive Roosevelt partisans and so his campaign never seemed to take a definite form. Wilson ran on his record and ignored Hughes, reserving his attacks for Roosevelt.'\n",
      "Chunk 96: 'When asked why he did not attack Hughes directly, Wilson told a friend to “Never murder a man who is committing suicide.” The final result was exceptionally close and the result was in doubt for several days. Because of Wilson's fear of becoming a lame duck president during the uncertainties of the war in Europe, he created a hypothetical plan where if Hughes were elected he would name Hughes secretary of state and then resign along with the vice-president to enable Hughes to become the president.'\n",

      "Chunk 99: 'Wilson was able to win reelection in 1916 by picking up many votes that had gone to Teddy Roosevelt or Eugene V. Debs in 1912. Wilson's second term focused almost exclusively on World War I, which for the US formally began on April 6, 1917, only a little over a month after the term began.'\n",
      "Chunk 100: 'After Wilson, the next U.S. President to win both of his terms with under 50% of the popular vote was fellow Democrat, Bill Clinton, in the 1992 and 1996 elections. When Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917 and made a clumsy attempt to enlist Mexico as an ally (see Zimmermann Telegram), Wilson took America into World War I as a war to make \"the world safe for democracy.\"'\n",
      "Chunk 101: 'He did not sign a formal alliance with Great Britain or France but operated as an \"Associated\" power. He raised a massive army through conscription and gave command to General John J. Pershing, allowing Pershing a free hand as to tactics, strategy and even diplomacy.'\n",

      "Chunk 103: 'Woodrow Wilson had decided by then that the war had become a real threat to humanity. Unless the U.S. threw its weight into the war, as he stated in his declaration of war speech, Western civilization itself could be destroyed.'\n",
      "Chunk 104: 'His statement announcing a \"war to end all wars\" meant that he wanted to build a basis for peace that would prevent future catastrophic wars and needless death and destruction. This provided the basis of Wilson's Fourteen Points, which were intended to resolve territorial disputes, ensure free trade and commerce, and establish a peacemaking organization, which later emerged as the League of Nations.'\n",
      "Chunk 105: 'To stop defeatism at home, Wilson pushed the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 through Congress to suppress anti-British, pro-German, or anti-war opinions. He welcomed socialists who supported the war, such as Walter Lippmann, but would not tolerate those who tried to impede the war or, worse, assassinate government officials, and pushed for deportation of foreign-born radicals.'\n",

The American Federation of Labor and other 'moderate' unions saw enormous growth in membership and wages during Wilson's administration.'\n",
      "Chunk 107: 'There was no rationing, so consumer prices soared. As income taxes increased, white-collar workers suffered.'\n",
      "Chunk 108: 'Appeals to buy war bonds were highly successful, however. Bonds had the result of shifting the cost of the war to the affluent 1920s.'\n",
      "Chunk 109: 'Wilson set up the United States Committee on Public Information, headed by George Creel (thus its popular name, Creel Commission), which filled the country with patriotic anti-German appeals and conducted various forms of censorship. President Woodrow Wilson articulated what became known as the Fourteen Points before Congress on January 8, 1918.'\n",
      "Chunk 110: 'The Points were the only war aims clearly expressed by any belligerent nation and thus became the basis for the Treaty of Versailles following World War I. The speech was highly idealistic, translating Wilson's progressive domestic policy of democracy, self-determination, open agreements, and free trade into the international realm.'\n",
      "Chunk 111: 'It also made several suggestions for specific disputes in Europe on the recommendation of Wilson's foreign policy advisor, Colonel Edward M. House, and his team of 150 advisors known as “The Inquiry.” The points were: Abolition of secret treaties Freedom of the seas Free Trade Disarmament Adjustment of colonial claims (decolonization and national self-determination) Russia to be assured independent development and international withdrawal from occupied Russian territory Restoration of Belgium to antebellum national status Alsace-Lorraine returned to France from Germany Italian borders redrawn on lines of nationality Autonomous development of Austria-Hungary as a nation, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, and other Balkan states to be granted integrity, have their territories deoccupied, and Serbia to be given access to the Adriatic Sea Sovereignty for the Turkish people of the Ottoman Empire as the Empire dissolved, autonomous development for other nationalities within the former Empire Establishment of an independent Poland with access to the sea General association of the nations – a multilateral international association of nations to enforce the peace (League of Nations) The speech was controversial in America, and even more so with their Allies. France wanted high reparations from Germany as French agriculture, industry, and lives had been so demolished by the war, and Britain, as the great naval power, did not want freedom of the seas.'\n",
      "Chunk 112: 'Wilson compromised with Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and many other European leaders during the Paris Peace talks to ensure that the fourteenth point, the League of Nations, would be established. In the end, Wilson's own Congress did not accept the League and only four of the original Fourteen Points were implemented fully in Europe.'\n",
      "Chunk 113: 'Between 1914 and 1918, the United States intervened in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, Haiti, Cuba, and Panama.

      "Chunk 115: 'After Russia left the war in 1917 following the Bolshevik Revolution the Allies sent troops, presumably, to prevent a German or Bolshevik takeover of allied-provided weapons, munitions and other supplies which had been previously shipped as aid to the Czarist government. Wilson sent armed forces to assist the withdrawal of Czech and Slovak prisoners along the Trans-Siberian Railway, hold key port cities at Arkangel and Vladivostok, and safeguard supplies sent to the Tsarist forces.'\n",
      "Chunk 116: 'Though not sent to engage the Bolsheviks, the U.S. forces had several armed conflicts against Russian forces. Wilson withdrew the soldiers on April 1, 1920, though some remained as late as 1922.'\n",

      "Chunk 122: 'Wilson intended the Fourteen Points as a means toward ending the war and achieving an equitable peace for all the nations. He spent six months at Paris for the 1919 Paris Peace Conference (making him the first U.S. president to travel to Europe while in office).'\n",
      "Chunk 123: 'He worked tirelessly to promote his plan. The charter of the proposed League of Nations was incorporated into the conference's Treaty of Versailles.'\n",
      "Chunk 124: 'For his peacemaking efforts, Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize. However, Wilson failed to win Senate support for ratification and the United States never joined the League.'\n",
      "Chunk 125: 'Republicans under Henry Cabot Lodge controlled the Senate after the 1918 elections, but Wilson refused to give them a voice at Paris and refused to agree to Lodge's proposed changes. The key point of disagreement was whether the League would diminish the power of Congress to declare war.'\n",
      "Chunk 126: 'Historians generally have come to regard Wilson's failure to win U.S. entry into the League as perhaps the biggest mistake of his administration, and even as one of the largest failures of any American presidency. /ref> Wilson had ignored the problems of demobilization after the war, and the process was chaotic and violent.'\n",

    "### Query 2 Analysis\n",
    "The search analysis for the query \"Who was Abraham Adams?\" with k=15 revealed 15 neighbors that provided insights mainly about the historical figure John Adams. The majority of the neighbors focused on his role in the American Revolution, his political career, and his personal life, including his family relationships and his stance on major social issues of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrieved neighbors offered a broad overview of Adams's influence during the American Revolution, highlighting his contributions as a \"driving force for independence\" and a key representative in the Continental Congress. These details emphasize his prominent role in American history, including his significant influence in drafting key founding documents such as the Declaration of Independence. This level of information effectively answers a query about his historical importance and achievements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results also shed light on John Adams's personality and personal experiences. For instance, his contentious nature and political career struggles are highlighted, which provides a deeper look into the challenges he faced during his time in public office. The retrieved neighbors also provide information on his reconciliation with Thomas Jefferson, illustrating a significant episode in his later life. Additionally, the neighbors explore Adams's family, including his children, and his wife Abigail Adams’s views on slavery, which adds richness to his historical portrait.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are certain limitations to the retrieved information. The primary issue is that the query asks about \"Abraham Adams,\" but the system retrieved information predominantly about John Adams. This suggests that the system's ability to discern between similar names or correctly resolve less common queries could be improved. Moreover, the neighbors contain some redundancy, as several of the entries repeat similar information, such as Adams's contributions to independence, his family life, and his political career. This repetition reduces the diversity of content and limits the breadth of information provided."

    "### Query 3 Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The search analysis for the query \"Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?\" with k=1 revealed a single neighbor that provided direct and relevant information about Lincoln's connection to the frontier. The retrieved neighbor specifically mentions that the area in question was considered the \"frontier\" and provides additional context by explaining that the name \"Abraham\" was chosen to honor Lincoln's grandfather, who was killed in an Indian raid in 1786.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result offers a concise and relevant response to the query, effectively establishing Lincoln's association with the frontier, which is the main focus of the question. The mention of his grandfather’s death also adds a meaningful historical detail that enriches the narrative. Given that the query was narrowly focused and k=1 was used, the system successfully returned an answer that was both direct and pertinent.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are notable limitations to the retrieved result. The use of a single neighbor (k=1) restricts the response's depth and comprehensiveness. While the result establishes the connection between Lincoln and the frontier, it lacks elaboration on Lincoln's experiences, daily life, and challenges while living in the frontier. Such additional context would have provided a more complete answer, helping the user understand Lincoln's formative years in greater detail. Increasing k could have allowed the system to retrieve additional information that would paint a fuller picture of Lincoln's life on the frontier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect to consider is the similarity metric used in determining the nearest neighbor. Since the retrieval system employed the Euclidean metric, it may have focused primarily on closeness in terms of numerical vector values rather than semantic diversity. This may have contributed to the narrowness of the retrieved content. A different similarity metric, such as cosine similarity, could potentially retrieve results with richer contextual diversity, thereby providing a more well-rounded answer."

    "The search analysis for the query \"Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?\" with k=20 produced a set of neighbors, many of which overlapped with those found in previous queries, particularly Query 4 (k=10). This overlap provides an opportunity to compare the relevance of the results across different k values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighbor 1 is again the most directly relevant, providing clear information about Lincoln's frontier experience and mentioning the naming of \"Abraham\" after his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid. Neighbor 2 repeats from Query 4, discussing the family's move from Kentucky and the land deed issues. Neighbor 3 describes Lincoln's roles in New Salem, reiterating his life in a frontier community. Neighbor 6 emphasizes Lincoln's \"pioneer background,\" which also appeared in Query 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighbor 17 describes Lincoln's family's move to a new homestead in Illinois and his journey to New Salem, adding depth to the understanding of Lincoln's frontier experience. Neighbor 13 provides additional context on Lincoln's early life in Indiana, which was also frontier-like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expanded k=20 search brought in new neighbors that provide mixed relevance. Neighbor 11 mentions Lincoln's stepmother, Sarah Bush Johnston, adding personal context to Lincoln's upbringing in a frontier environment. Neighbor 12 touches on Lincoln's moral beliefs, indirectly connecting to values that may have influenced his frontier life. Neighbor 15 discusses Lincoln's father's pro-slavery stance, contrasting with Lincoln's beliefs and adding background on the challenges Lincoln faced in shaping his views while living in a frontier setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighbor 17 describes the difficult winter the Lincoln family endured before moving to Illinois and Lincoln's journey to New Salem, reinforcing the idea of constant movement and struggle. Neighbor 19 highlights Lincoln's aversion to hunting and fishing, suggesting a nuanced aspect of his frontier life. Neighbor 18 provides insight into Lincoln's intellectual pursuits, emphasizing his dedication to self-education despite the hardships of frontier life.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, many additional neighbors are less directly relevant. For example, Neighbor 20 describes Lincoln being celebrated by freed slaves, which does not contribute to understanding his frontier experience. Neighbor 16 discusses Lincoln's political stance on economic advancement and territorial expansion, which, while related to frontier expansion, is not specific to his personal frontier life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between Queries 4 and 5 demonstrates that increasing the value of k results in a wider array of information but at the cost of more tangential content. Query 5 included many of the same relevant pieces of information found in Query 4, but with additional, less focused content that diluted the overall relevance. For a narrow query like Lincoln's frontier experience, a smaller k value might provide more concentrated and useful results."

      "Neighbor 26: His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government.\n",

      "Neighbor 29: Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the sixteenth President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1861 until his assassination. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\"\n",
      "Neighbor 30: The Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery is located in Elwood, Illinois.\n",
      "Neighbor 31: Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.\n",
      "Neighbor 32: 57-59 Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life.\n",
      "Neighbor 33: He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states.

      "Neighbor 34: The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs.\n",
      "Neighbor 35: The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land.\n",
      "Neighbor 36: With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party.\n",
      "Neighbor 37: Then, Grant dispatched Philip Sheridan to the Shenandoah Valley to deal with Early. It became clear to the people of the North that the war was being won, and Lincoln was re-elected by a wide margin.\n",
      "Neighbor 38: Early invaded north through the Shenandoah Valley and reached the outskirts of Washington, D.C.. Although unable to take the city, Early embarrassed the Administration simply by threatening its inhabitants, making Abraham Lincoln's re-election prospects even bleaker.\n",
      "Neighbor 39: 7. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day: Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party.\n",
      "Neighbor 40: There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\"\n",
      "Neighbor 41: Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits.\n",
      "Neighbor 42: He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\" Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551 Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.\n",
      "Neighbor 43: Young Abraham Lincoln Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party. He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.\n",
      "Neighbor 44: Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War.\n",
      "Neighbor 45: 251-254 After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary: Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg.\n",
      "Neighbor 46: Guelzo pg. 18-19 There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives.\n",
      "Neighbor 47: Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery.\n",
      "Neighbor 48: Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.\n",
      "Neighbor 49: The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4; On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party.\n",
      "Neighbor 50: One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman). Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862.\n",
      "Neighbor 1: This area was at the time considered the \"frontier.\" The name \"Abraham\" was chosen to commemorate his grandfather, who was killed in an American Indian raid in 1786.\n",
      "Neighbor 2: He later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery,\" and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky: Unlike land in the Northwest Territory, Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey, and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property.

The following year, when his father relocated the family to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, twenty-two-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon River to the village of New Salem in Sangamon County.\n",
      "Neighbor 18: just to borrow one While his favorite book was The Life of George Washington, Lincoln mastered the Bible, Shakespeare, and English and American history, and developed a plain writing style that puzzled audiences more used to grandiose rhetoric. He was also a talented local wrestler and skilled with an ax; some rails he had allegedly split in his youth were exhibited at the 1860 Republican National Convention, as the party celebrated the poor-boy-made-good theme.\n",
      "Neighbor 19: Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing because he did not like killing animals, even for food. Though he was unusually tall at , 4 inches and strong, Lincoln spent so much time reading that some neighbors suspected he must be doing it to avoid strenuous manual labor.\n",
      "Neighbor 20: He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer's quote, \"I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"\n",
      "Neighbor 21: Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois on 1 August, 1843. Their only child to survive into adulthood, young Robert attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College.\n",
      "Neighbor 22: Yet despite his Southern connections (his in-laws owned slaves), Lincoln misunderstood the depth of the revolution underway in the South and the emergence of Southern nationalism. Throughout the 1850s he denied that there would ever be a civil war, and his supporters repeatedly rejected claims that his election would incite secession.\n",
      "Neighbor 23: While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States, Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered an unconstitutional tyrant. The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, is 177 feet (54 m) tall and, by 1874, was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln.\n",
      "Neighbor 24: Robert died on July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont. The other Lincoln children were born in Springfield, Illinois, and died either during childhood or their teen years.\n",
      "Neighbor 25: See Hofstadter, Richard, The United States: The History of a Republic, Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 446. Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing cities.\n",
      "Neighbor 26: His \"Western\" origins also appealed to the newer states: other contenders, especially those with more governmental experience, had acquired enemies within the party and were weak in the critical western states, while Lincoln was perceived as a moderate who could win the West. Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government.\n",
      "Neighbor 27: He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December of 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt. The farm site is now preserved as part of Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site.\n",
      "Neighbor 28: In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on public land /ref> in Macon County, Illinois. Some scholars believe that it was his father's repeated land-title difficulties and ensuing financial hardships that led young Lincoln to study law.\n",
      "Neighbor 29: Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the sixteenth President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1861 until his assassination. As an outspoken opponent of the expansion of slavery in the United States, \"[I]n his short autobiography written for the 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln would describe his protest in the Illinois legislature as one that 'briefly defined his position on the slavery question, and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now.\"\n",
      "Neighbor 30: The Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery is located in Elwood, Illinois.\n",
      "Neighbor 31: Jaffa (2000) p. 399, stresses Lincoln's emphasis on the Declaration of Independence as what Lincoln called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism. See also McPherson (1992) pp.61-64.\n",
      "Neighbor 32: 57-59 Lincoln’s reading and study of the Bible was an integral part of his intellectual roots. Lincoln did, even as a boy, largely reject organized religion, but the Calvinistic \"doctrine of necessity\" would remain a factor throughout his life.\n",
      "Neighbor 33: He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South, and won only 2 of 996 counties in the other Southern states. Lincoln gained 1,865,908 votes (39.9% of the total), for 180 electoral votes; Douglas, 1,380,202 (29.5%) for 12 electoral votes; Breckenridge, 848,019 (18.1%) for 72 electoral votes; and Bell, 590,901 (12.5%) for 39 electoral votes.\n",
      "Neighbor 34: The philosophical basis for Lincoln’s beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined \"seriously as a man of ideas.\" Lincoln was a strong supporter of the American Whig version of liberal capitalism who, more than most politicians of the time, was able to express his ideas within the context of Nineteenth Century religious beliefs.\n",
      "Neighbor 35: The other rebel armies surrendered soon after, and there was no subsequent guerrilla warfare. Lincoln went to Richmond to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land.\n",
      "Neighbor 36: With a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and in his closing arguments, Lincoln became one of the most respected and successful lawyers in Illinois and grew steadily more prosperous. He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County, and became a leader of the Illinois Whig party.\n",
      "Neighbor 37: Then, Grant dispatched Philip Sheridan to the Shenandoah Valley to deal with Early. It became clear to the people of the North that the war was being won, and Lincoln was re-elected by a wide margin.\n",
      "Neighbor 38: Early invaded north through the Shenandoah Valley and reached the outskirts of Washington, D.C.. Although unable to take the city, Early embarrassed the Administration simply by threatening its inhabitants, making Abraham Lincoln's re-election prospects even bleaker.\n",
      "Neighbor 39: 7. In a speech against the act, on October 16 1854, delivered in Peoria, Lincoln first stood out among the other free soil orators of the day: Drawing on remnants of the old Whig, Free Soil, Liberty and Democratic parties, he was instrumental in forming the new Republican Party.\n",
      "Neighbor 40: There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer that Lincoln would credit in later years as a strong influence on his intellectual development. Lacking a formal education, Lincoln’s personal philosophy was shaped by \"an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.\"\n",
      "Neighbor 41: Lincoln's birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, and the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum opened in Springfield in 2005; it is a major tourist attraction, with state-of-the-art exhibits.\n",
      "Neighbor 42: He was elected captain of an Illinois militia company drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, and later wrote that he had not had \"any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.\" Thomas (1952) 32-34; Basler (1946) p. 551 Though he never saw combat, Lincoln did assist in burying the dead from the Battle of Stillman's Run the day after Major Isaiah Stillman's troops fled the field of battle.\n",
      "Neighbor 43: Young Abraham Lincoln Lincoln began his political career in 1832, at age 23, with an unsuccessful campaign for the Illinois General Assembly, as a member of the Whig Party. He ran eighth in a field of 13 candidates.\n",
      "Neighbor 44: Lincoln won the Republican Party nomination in 1860 and was elected president later that year. During his term, he helped preserve the United States by leading the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War.\n",
      "Neighbor 45: 251-254 After Willie’s death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private musings on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary: Lincoln’s religious skepticism was fueled by his exposure to the ideas of the Lockean Enlightenment and classical liberalism, especially economic liberalism. Guelzo pg.\n",
      "Neighbor 46: Guelzo pg. 18-19 There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives.\n",
      "Neighbor 47: Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery.\n",
      "Neighbor 48: Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.\n",
      "Neighbor 49: The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4; On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party.\n",
      "Neighbor 50: One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman). Lincoln met with his cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862.\n"

    "### Query 6 Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The search analysis for the query \"Did Abraham Lincoln live in the Frontier?\" with k=50 produced a diverse set of neighbors, many of which overlap with previous queries, particularly Queries 4 and 5. However, expanding the value of k to 50 introduced additional perspectives, including more nuanced details about Lincoln's life and broader historical context, albeit with more tangential information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the previously discussed neighbors, the expanded k=50 search includes new details that add depth to Lincoln's frontier experience. Neighbor 27 mentions the Sinking Spring Farm, which Lincoln's father purchased, now preserved as part of the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site. This adds another layer of context to Lincoln's early life on the frontier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighbor 28 discusses the family's relocation to Macon County, Illinois, due to land-title difficulties, which connects directly to the struggles often faced by frontier settlers. This neighbor adds depth to understanding how these hardships influenced Lincoln's decision to study law. Neighbor 42 mentions Lincoln's election as captain of an Illinois militia company during the Black Hawk War, further illustrating his involvement in frontier life and community leadership.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expanded set also introduces less directly relevant neighbors. For example, Neighbor 22 discusses Lincoln's misunderstanding of Southern nationalism, and Neighbor 20 describes Lincoln being celebrated by freed slaves—details that, while significant historically, are not directly tied to his frontier life. Neighbor 35 mentions Lincoln's visit to Richmond after the Civil War, which is unrelated to the specific query about his frontier experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, increasing k to 50 provided a broader array of information, including both additional relevant details and a significant number of tangential entries. The new neighbors added depth to Lincoln's frontier narrative, such as the family's repeated relocations and Lincoln's role in the militia. However, many neighbors diverged from the core topic, diluting the focus. This suggests that while a larger k value can enrich the context, it also risks including more irrelevant information, which may reduce the overall utility for specific, narrow queries."

      "Neighbor 1: Instead, Fillmore joined the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic American Party, the political organ of the Know-Nothing movement. He ran in the election of 1856 as the party's candidate, attempting to win a non-consecutive second term as President (a feat accomplished only once in American politics, by Grover Cleveland).\n",

Another primary objective of Fillmore was to preserve the Union from the intensifying slavery debate.\n",
      "Neighbor 3: Fillmore signaled this shift by appointing Daniel Webster as his Secretary of State. As president, Fillmore dealt with increasing party divisions within the Whig party; party harmony became one of his primary objectives.\n",

      "Neighbor 5: Fillmore was never elected President; after serving out Taylor's term, he failed to gain the nomination for the Presidency of the Whigs in the 1852 presidential election, and, four years later, in the 1856 presidential election, he again failed to win election as President as the Know Nothing Party and Whig candidate. Fillmore was born in a log cabin in Summerhill, New York, to Nathaniel and Phoebe Millard Fillmore, as the second of nine children and the eldest son.\n",
      "Neighbor 6: His solution was to appease both northern and southern Whigs by calling for the enforcement of the fugitive slave law in the North, and enforcing in the South a law forbidding involvement in Cuba (for the sole purpose of adding it as a slave state). Another issue that presented itself during Fillmore's presidency was the arrival of Louis Kossuth (exiled leader of a failed Hungarian revolution).\n",

He was the second Vice President to assume the Presidency upon the death of a sitting President, succeeding Zachary Taylor who died of acute gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Neighbor 8: Upon completing his presidency, Fillmore returned to Buffalo, where he continued to serve as chancellor. After the death of his daughter Mary, Fillmore went abroad.\n",

    "\n",
    "The search analysis for the query \"How did Fillmore ascend to the presidency?\" with k=15 produced relevant neighbors, detailing Millard Fillmore's path to the presidency and the context of his political career. The most pertinent neighbor for answering the query is Neighbor 4, which clearly states that Fillmore ascended to the presidency upon the sudden death of President Zachary Taylor in July 1850. It also describes the subsequent political shift that occurred when Fillmore replaced Taylor's cabinet to align with his agenda, particularly regarding the Compromise of 1850.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neighbor 7 further supports this explanation by emphasizing that Fillmore was the second Vice President to assume the presidency due to the death of a sitting president, highlighting the specific circumstances of Taylor's death. Neighbor 13 also mentions Fillmore's role in presiding over the Senate during intense debates leading up to the Compromise of 1850, which ties into the transition in leadership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other neighbors provide additional context about Fillmore's career and political maneuvering, which is useful for understanding the political atmosphere during his rise. For example, Neighbor 15 explains his nomination for vice president during the Whig convention in 1848, intended to balance the ticket and heal divisions within the party. This nomination was crucial, as it positioned him to become vice president and later ascend to the presidency. Neighbor 3 adds that Fillmore faced significant party divisions as president and sought to maintain Whig unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several neighbors, while interesting, provide less directly relevant information. Neighbor 1 discusses Fillmore’s post-presidency involvement with the Know-Nothing Party, while Neighbor 5 elaborates on his unsuccessful attempts to gain the presidential nomination after Taylor's term ended. These details, while part of Fillmore's overall political story, are not central to explaining how he initially ascended to the presidency. Similarly, Neighbor 6 touches on Fillmore’s policy initiatives during his presidency, such as enforcing the fugitive slave law, which is more about his presidential actions rather than his rise to power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the neighbors provided a clear picture of how Fillmore became president, emphasizing the unexpected death of Zachary Taylor as the catalyst for his ascension. The additional details on his political maneuvering, cabinet appointments, and attempts to maintain party harmony offer useful context but do not directly explain his path to the presidency."

      "Neighbor 1: After his term in the Senate, Monroe was appointed Minister to France from 1794 to 1796. His appointment there was made difficult as he had strong sympathies for the French Revolution, but dutifully maintained President Washington's strict policy of neutrality between Britiain and France.\n",
      "Neighbor 2: In the late stages of the war he took personal control of negotiations with Germany, especially with the Fourteen Points and the Armistice. He went to Paris in 1919 to create the League of Nations and shape the Treaty of Versailles, with special attention on creating new nations out of defunct empires.\n",
      "Neighbor 3: It also made several suggestions for specific disputes in Europe on the recommendation of Wilson's foreign policy advisor, Colonel Edward M. House, and his team of 150 advisors known as “The Inquiry.” The points were: Abolition of secret treaties Freedom of the seas Free Trade Disarmament Adjustment of colonial claims (decolonization and national self-determination) Russia to be assured independent development and international withdrawal from occupied Russian territory Restoration of Belgium to antebellum national status Alsace-Lorraine returned to France from Germany Italian borders redrawn on lines of nationality Autonomous development of Austria-Hungary as a nation, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, and other Balkan states to be granted integrity, have their territories deoccupied, and Serbia to be given access to the Adriatic Sea Sovereignty for the Turkish people of the Ottoman Empire as the Empire dissolved, autonomous development for other nationalities within the former Empire Establishment of an independent Poland with access to the sea General association of the nations – a multilateral international association of nations to enforce the peace (League of Nations) The speech was controversial in America, and even more so with their Allies. France wanted high reparations from Germany as French agriculture, industry, and lives had been so demolished by the war, and Britain, as the great naval power, did not want freedom of the seas.\n",
      "Neighbor 4: Because the French helped secure American independence from Britain they had greater popularity with America. After the Jay treaty with Great Britain the French became angry and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British.\n",
      "Neighbor 5: With the aid of the Dutch patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states had been the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition, in 1778).\n",
      "Neighbor 6: The French government, however, did not approve of Adams’s appointment and subsequently, on the insistence of the French foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay and Henry Laurens were appointed to cooperate with Adams. In the event Jay, Adams and Franklin played the major part in the negotiations.\n",

Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.\n",
      "Neighbor 8: Wilson compromised with Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and many other European leaders during the Paris Peace talks to ensure that the fourteenth point, the League of Nations, would be established. In the end, Wilson's own Congress did not accept the League and only four of the original Fourteen Points were implemented fully in Europe.\n",
      "Neighbor 9: Wilson intended the Fourteen Points as a means toward ending the war and achieving an equitable peace for all the nations. He spent six months at Paris for the 1919 Paris Peace Conference (making him the first U.S. president to travel to Europe while in office).\n",
      "Neighbor 10: The humiliation of the XYZ Affair, in which the French demanded huge bribes before any discussions could begin, led to serious threats of full-scale war with France and embarrassed the Jeffersonians, who were friends to France. The Federalists built up the army under George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, built warships, such as the USS Constitution, and raised taxes.\n",
      "Neighbor 11: Ferling (1992) ch 8. An 1813 letter by Adams, in which he said that one-third of the people supported the revolution, refers to the French revolution in the 1790s.\n",
      "Neighbor 12: Overruling Franklin, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France; instead, they dealt directly with the British commissioners. Ferling (1992) ch 11-12 Throughout the negotiations, Adams was especially determined that the right of the United States to the fisheries along the Atlantic coast should be recognized.\n",
      "Neighbor 13: Britain and France were at war; Adams and the Federalists favored Britain, while Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans favored France. An undeclared naval war between the U.S. and France, called the Quasi-War, broke out in 1798.\n",
      "Neighbor 14: p 331 For long stretches, Adams withdrew to his home in Massachusetts. In February 1799, Adams stunned the country by sending diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France.\n",
      "Neighbor 15: Up till 1794 a total of eleven loans were granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders. In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce, the second such treaty between the United States and a foreign power (after the 1778 treaty with France).\n",
      "Neighbor 1: After his term in the Senate, Monroe was appointed Minister to France from 1794 to 1796. His appointment there was made difficult as he had strong sympathies for the French Revolution, but dutifully maintained President Washington's strict policy of neutrality between Britiain and France.\n",
      "Neighbor 2: In the late stages of the war he took personal control of negotiations with Germany, especially with the Fourteen Points and the Armistice. He went to Paris in 1919 to create the League of Nations and shape the Treaty of Versailles, with special attention on creating new nations out of defunct empires.\n",
      "Neighbor 3: It also made several suggestions for specific disputes in Europe on the recommendation of Wilson's foreign policy advisor, Colonel Edward M. House, and his team of 150 advisors known as “The Inquiry.” The points were: Abolition of secret treaties Freedom of the seas Free Trade Disarmament Adjustment of colonial claims (decolonization and national self-determination) Russia to be assured independent development and international withdrawal from occupied Russian territory Restoration of Belgium to antebellum national status Alsace-Lorraine returned to France from Germany Italian borders redrawn on lines of nationality Autonomous development of Austria-Hungary as a nation, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, and other Balkan states to be granted integrity, have their territories deoccupied, and Serbia to be given access to the Adriatic Sea Sovereignty for the Turkish people of the Ottoman Empire as the Empire dissolved, autonomous development for other nationalities within the former Empire Establishment of an independent Poland with access to the sea General association of the nations – a multilateral international association of nations to enforce the peace (League of Nations) The speech was controversial in America, and even more so with their Allies. France wanted high reparations from Germany as French agriculture, industry, and lives had been so demolished by the war, and Britain, as the great naval power, did not want freedom of the seas.\n",
      "Neighbor 4: Because the French helped secure American independence from Britain they had greater popularity with America. After the Jay treaty with Great Britain the French became angry and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British.\n",
      "Neighbor 5: With the aid of the Dutch patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states had been the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition, in 1778).\n",
      "Neighbor 6: The French government, however, did not approve of Adams’s appointment and subsequently, on the insistence of the French foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay and Henry Laurens were appointed to cooperate with Adams. In the event Jay, Adams and Franklin played the major part in the negotiations.\n",
      "Neighbor 7: The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.

      "Neighbor 5: These focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, making the most of his boyhood poverty, his pioneer background, his native genius, and his rise from obscurity. His nicknames, \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Rail-Splitter,\" were exploited to the full.\n",

      "Neighbor 7: This finally happened in April 1861. Historian Allan Nevins argues that Lincoln made three miscalculations in believing that he could preserve the Union, hold government property, and still avoid war.\n",
      "Neighbor 8: Entering the presidential nomination process as a distinct underdog, Lincoln was eventually chosen as the Republican candidate for the 1860 election for several reasons.

      "Context 2: Millard Fillmore Millard Fillmore (January 7, 1800 March 8, 1874) was the thirteenth President of the United States, serving from 1850 until 1853, and the last member of the Whig Party to hold that office. He was the second Vice President to assume the Presidency upon the death of a sitting President, succeeding Zachary Taylor who died of acute gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Context 3: Fillmore was never elected President; after serving out Taylor's term, he failed to gain the nomination for the Presidency of the Whigs in the 1852 presidential election, and, four years later, in the 1856 presidential election, he again failed to win election as President as the Know Nothing Party and Whig candidate. Fillmore was born in a log cabin in Summerhill, New York, to Nathaniel and Phoebe Millard Fillmore, as the second of nine children and the eldest son.\n",

      "Context 6: Instead, Fillmore joined the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic American Party, the political organ of the Know-Nothing movement. He ran in the election of 1856 as the party's candidate, attempting to win a non-consecutive second term as President (a feat accomplished only once in American politics, by Grover Cleveland).\n",

      "Context 8: His solution was to appease both northern and southern Whigs by calling for the enforcement of the fugitive slave law in the North, and enforcing in the South a law forbidding involvement in Cuba (for the sole purpose of adding it as a slave state).

House, and his team of 150 advisors known as “The Inquiry.” The points were: Abolition of secret treaties Freedom of the seas Free Trade Disarmament Adjustment of colonial claims (decolonization and national self-determination) Russia to be assured independent development and international withdrawal from occupied Russian territory Restoration of Belgium to antebellum national status Alsace-Lorraine returned to France from Germany Italian borders redrawn on lines of nationality Autonomous development of Austria-Hungary as a nation, as the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, and other Balkan states to be granted integrity, have their territories deoccupied, and Serbia to be given access to the Adriatic Sea Sovereignty for the Turkish people of the Ottoman Empire as the Empire dissolved, autonomous development for other nationalities within the former Empire Establishment of an independent Poland with access to the sea General association of the nations – a multilateral international association of nations to enforce the peace (League of Nations) The speech was controversial in America, and even more so with their Allies. France wanted high reparations from Germany as French agriculture, industry, and lives had been so demolished by the war, and Britain, as the great naval power, did not want freedom of the seas.\n",
      "Context 4: Because the French helped secure American independence from Britain they had greater popularity with America. After the Jay treaty with Great Britain the French became angry and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British.\n",
      "Context 5: With the aid of the Dutch patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states had been the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition, in 1778).\n",
      "Context 6: The French government, however, did not approve of Adams’s appointment and subsequently, on the insistence of the French foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay and Henry Laurens were appointed to cooperate with Adams. In the event Jay, Adams and Franklin played the major part in the negotiations.\n",
      "Context 7: The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln. Counties in 19 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.\n",
      "Context 8: Wilson compromised with Clemenceau, Lloyd George, and many other European leaders during the Paris Peace talks to ensure that the fourteenth point, the League of Nations, would be established. In the end, Wilson's own Congress did not accept the League and only four of the original Fourteen Points were implemented fully in Europe.\n",
      "Context 9: Wilson intended the Fourteen Points as a means toward ending the war and achieving an equitable peace for all the nations. He spent six months at Paris for the 1919 Paris Peace Conference (making him the first U.S. president to travel to Europe while in office).\n",
      "Context 10: The humiliation of the XYZ Affair, in which the French demanded huge bribes before any discussions could begin, led to serious threats of full-scale war with France and embarrassed the Jeffersonians, who were friends to France. The Federalists built up the army under George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, built warships, such as the USS Constitution, and raised taxes.\n",
      "Context 11: Ferling (1992) ch 8. An 1813 letter by Adams, in which he said that one-third of the people supported the revolution, refers to the French revolution in the 1790s.\n",
      "Context 12: Overruling Franklin, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France; instead, they dealt directly with the British commissioners. Ferling (1992) ch 11-12 Throughout the negotiations, Adams was especially determined that the right of the United States to the fisheries along the Atlantic coast should be recognized.\n",
      "Context 13: Britain and France were at war; Adams and the Federalists favored Britain, while Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans favored France. An undeclared naval war between the U.S. and France, called the Quasi-War, broke out in 1798.\n",
      "Context 14: p 331 For long stretches, Adams withdrew to his home in Massachusetts. In February 1799, Adams stunned the country by sending diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France.\n",
      "Context 15: Up till 1794 a total of eleven loans were granted in Amsterdam to the United States with a value of 29 million guilders. In October 1782, a treaty of amity and commerce, the second such treaty between the United States and a foreign power (after the 1778 treaty with France).\n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of the output from the generate_answer() function with different query inputs, k values, and reranking options reveals various insights into the performance of the context-answering pipeline. For the query, “How did Fillmore ascend to the presidency?” the generated answers were consistent across different k values of 1, 5, 10, and 20. All the responses conveyed that Millard Fillmore assumed the presidency following the death of President Zachary Taylor in July 1850. This consistency implies that even a small k value was sufficient to retrieve the appropriate context for this specific question. It also indicates that reranking did not lead to significant changes in the outcome, suggesting that the correct context was consistently retrieved regardless of how many neighbors were used in the initial search.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of reranking became evident when examining queries such as “Who was Abraham Lincoln?” and “Who was Abraham Adams?” In both cases, the answers generated with and without reranking were similar, differing mainly in minor phrasing choices. For example, the difference between mentioning Lincoln’s role in “ending slavery” versus “opposing the expansion of slavery” can be attributed to the reranker’s ability to refine content for nuance. However, in both cases, the core factual information remained unchanged. This suggests that reranking, while beneficial for readability and subtle differences, may not substantially alter the content when the correct context is already present in the retrieved neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some of the queries, particularly those seeking factual answers, the generated responses consistently returned “No context.” This occurred in response to questions such as “What trail did Lincoln use a Farmers’ Almanac in?” and “What is the capital of France?” The inability to provide a straightforward answer like “Paris” suggests that the relevant information either does not exist in the current corpus or that the search model struggled to effectively retrieve it. This highlights a gap in either the dataset or the search model’s ability to locate concise, factual information, particularly for direct questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another notable observation concerns the query about Abraham Adams. The responses indicated that \"Abraham Adams is not mentioned,\" which is actually a positive aspect of the model's response. The model correctly identifies that this entity does not exist within the corpus, showing that it does not fabricate information when it lacks the necessary context. This accuracy is crucial in maintaining the reliability of generated answers. This reliance on corpus content also means that if a specific entity or topic is not present in the corpus, the model will truthfully indicate its absence, rather than generating a misleading or incorrect response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the question, \"What is the capital of France?\" the model's response of \"No context\" is due to the hardcoded behavior within the generate_answer function when no relevant context is found. This does not reflect the model's inability to provide factual information like \"Paris,\" but rather the logic imposed by the current implementation of the code. The function is designed to output \"No context\" whenever it cannot find relevant information within the indexed data, even if the model itself has the knowledge to answer such straightforward questions, to minimize hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the performance of the generate_answer() function demonstrates both strengths and areas for improvement. While the model performs well for queries where context is available, it struggles with providing concise factual answers and retrieving relevant information for uncommon entities. Addressing these limitations through improved corpus coverage, external fact integration, and reranking enhancements can help create a more robust and effective context-answering pipeline."
