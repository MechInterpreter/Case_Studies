He was defeated for re-election in the \"Revolution of 1800\" by Thomas Jefferson. Adams was also the first President to reside in the newly built White House in Washington, D.C., which was completed in 1800.\n",

      "Adams, a sponsor of the American Revolution in Massachusetts, was a driving force for independence in 1776; Jefferson called him the \"Colossus of Independence\". He represented the Continental Congress in Europe. He was a major negotiator of the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain, and chiefly responsible for obtaining the loans from the Amsterdam money market necessary for the conduct of the Revolution. His prestige secured his two elections as Washington's Vice President and his election to succeed him.   As President, he was frustrated by battles inside his own Federalist party against a faction led by Alexander Hamilton, but he broke with them to avert a major conflict with France in 1798, during the Quasi-War crisis. He became the founder of an important family of politicians, diplomats and historians, and in recent years his reputation has improved.\n",

      "John Adams was the oldest of three brothers, born on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735 by the Old Style, Julian calendar), in Braintree, Massachusetts, though in an area which became part of Quincy, Massachusetts in 1792. His birthplace is now part of Adams National Historical Park. His father, a farmer and a Deacon, also named John (1690-1761), was a fourth-generation descendant of Henry Adams, who immigrated from Barton St David, Somerset, England, to Massachusetts Bay Colony in about 1636, from a Welsh male line called Ap Adam.  /ref> His mother was Susanna Boylston Adams.

      "Young Adams went to Harvard College at age sixteen (in 1751). MSN Encarta, John Adams  His father expected him to become a minister, but Adams had doubts.  After graduating in 1755, he taught school for a few years in Worcester, allowing himself time to think about his career choice.  After much reflection, he decided to become a lawyer, and studied law in the office of James Putnam, a prominent lawyer in Worcester. In 1758, he was admitted to the bar. From an early age, he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men.  These litter his diary.  He put the skill to good use as a lawyer, often recording cases he observed so that he could study and reflect upon them.  His report of the 1761 argument of James Otis in the superior court of Massachusetts as to the legality of Writs of Assistance is a good example. Otis’s argument inspired Adams with zeal for the cause of the American colonies.  Ferling (1992) ch 2\n",

      "In 1764, Adams married Abigail Smith (1744–1818), the daughter of a Congregational minister,Rev. William Smith, at Weymouth, Massachusetts. Their children were Abigail (1765-1813); future president John Quincy (1767-1848); Susanna (1768–1770); Charles (1770-1800); Thomas Boylston (1772-1832); and Elizabeth (1775) who was stillborn.\n",

      "Adams was not a popular leader like his second cousin, Samuel Adams; instead, his influence emerged through his work as a constitutional lawyer and his intense analysis of historical examples, Ferling (1992) p 117  together with his thorough knowledge of the law and his dedication to the principles of republicanism. Adams often found his inborn contentiousness to be a restraint in his political career.\n",

      "Adams wanted to secure approval from the people, and he saw his chance in the British/colonial conflict. He became well known for his essays and energetic resolutions against British taxation and regulation. In 1774 Massachusetts sent him to the Continental Congress. In 1775 war broke out between the colonies and Great Britain. Adams was one of the first few delegates to recognize that a compromise with the British was pointless. In 1776 he worked hard to break away from Britain by using a formal declaration of independence. On July 2, 1776 Congress voted for the resolution, \"these colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states.\"  Two days later, they passed the Declaration of Independence.\n",

      "Adams first rose to prominence as an opponent of the Stamp Act of 1765. In that year, he drafted the instructions which were sent by the inhabitants of Braintree to its representatives in the Massachusetts legislature, and which served as a model for other towns to draw up instructions to their representatives. In August 1765, he anonymously contributed four notable articles to the Boston Gazette (republished in The London Chronicle in 1768 as True Sentiments of America and also known as A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law).  In the letter he suggested that there was a connection between the Protestant ideas that Adams' Puritan ancestors brought to New England and the ideas that suggested they resist the Stamp Act.  In the former he explained that the opposition of the colonies to the Stamp Act was because the Stamp Act deprived the American colonists of two basic rights guaranteed to all Englishmen, and which all free men deserved: rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried only by a jury of one's peers.  The \"Braintree Instructions\" were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties, while the Dissertation was an essay in political education.\n",

The soldiers involved, who were arrested on criminal charges, had trouble finding legal counsel.  Finally, they asked Adams to defend them.  Although he feared it would hurt his reputation, he agreed. One of the soldiers, Captain Thomas Preston gave Adams a symbolic \"single guinea\" as a retaining fee, Chinard, John Adams, 58-60  the only fee he received in the case. Or, as stated in the biography of John Adams by David McCullough, Adams received nothing more than a retainer of eighteen guineas. McCullough, John Adams, pg. 66\n",

Boston radicals protested and asked Adams to explain their objections.  In \"Two Replies of the Massachusetts House of Representatives to Governor Hutchinson\" Adams argued that the colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament. Their original charter was with the person of the king and their allegiance was only to him.  If a workable line could not be drawn between parliamentary sovereignty and the total independence of the colonies, he continued, the colonies would have no other choice but to choose independence.\n",

      "In Novanglus; or, A History of the Dispute with America, From Its Origin, in 1754, to the Present Time Adams attacked some essays by Daniel Leonard that defended Hutchinson's arguments for the absolute authority of Parliament over the colonies. In Novanglus Adams gave a point-by-point refutation of Leonard's essays, and then provided one of the most extensive and learned arguments made by the colonists against British imperial policy. It was a systematic attempt by Adams to describe the origins, nature, and jurisdiction of the unwritten British constitution. Adams used his wide knowledge of English and colonial legal history to show the provincial legislatures were fully sovereign over their own internal affairs, and that the colonies were connected to Great Britain only through the King.\n",

In June 1775, with a view of promoting the union of the colonies, he nominated George Washington of Virginia as commander-in-chief of the army then assembled around Boston.

      "Over the next decade, Americans from every state gathered and deliberated on new governing documents. As radical as it was to actually write constitutions (prior convention suggested that a society's form of government needn't be codified, nor should its organic law be written down in a single document), what was equally radical was the nature of American political thought as the summer of 1776 dawned.

      "At that time several Congressmen turned to Adams for advice about framing new governments.  Adams tired of repeating the same thing, and published the pamphlet Thoughts on Government (1776), which was subsequently influential in the writing of many state constitutions. Many historians argue that Thoughts on Government should be read as an articulation of the classical theory of mixed government.  Adams contended that social classes exist in every political society, and that a good government must accept that reality. For centuries, dating back to Aristotle, a mixed regime balancing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, or the monarch, nobles, and people was required to preserve order and liberty.  Ferling (1992) pp 155-7, 213-5\n",

      "Using the tools of Republicanism in the United States the patriots believed it was corrupt and nefarious aristocrats, in the English Parliament and stationed in America, who were guilty of the British assault on American liberty.  Unlike others, Adams thought that the definition of a republic had to do with its ends, rather than its means.  He wrote in Thoughts on Government, \"there is no good government but what is republican. That the only valuable part of the British constitution is so; because the very definition of a republic is 'an empire of laws, and not of men.'\"  Thoughts on Government defended bicameralism, for \"a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies, and frailties of an individual.\" Thoughts on Government, Works of John Adams, IV:195  He also suggested that the executive should be independent, as should the judiciary.

Although that document was largely drafted by Jefferson, Adams occupied the foremost place in the debate on its adoption. He deferred the writing to Jefferson believing it would be better received having been written by him. Adams believed Jefferson wrote profoundly better than any man in Congress, and he himself was \"obnoxious and disliked.\" Many years later, Jefferson hailed Adams as, \"The Colossus of that Congress the great pillar of support to the Declaration of Independence, and its ablest advocate and champion on the floor of the House.\" Lipscomb & Bergh, eds.

On the second trip, he was appointed as minister plenipotentiary charged with the mission of negotiating a treaty of peace and a treaty of commerce with Great Britain; he went to Europe in September 1779. The French government, however, did not approve of Adams’s appointment and subsequently, on the insistence of the French foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay and Henry Laurens were appointed to cooperate with Adams. In the event Jay, Adams and Franklin played the major part in the negotiations.

The treaty was signed on November 30, 1782.\n",

      "After these negotiations began, Adams had spent some time as the ambassador in the Netherlands, then the only other well-functioning Republic in the world.  In July 1780, he had been authorized to execute the duties previously assigned to Laurens. With the aid of the Dutch patriot leader Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams secured the recognition of the United States as an independent government at The Hague on April 19, 1782. In February 1782 the Frisian states had been the first Dutch province to recognize the United States, while France had been the first European country to grant diplomatic recognition, in 1778).  During this visit, he also negotiated a loan of five million guilders. It was floated by Nicolaas van Staphorst and Wilhelm Willink.

The Massachusetts Constitution of 1780: A Social Compact (1978) p 13 says Adams was its \"principal architect.\"  It was the first constitution written by a special committee and ratified by the people.

      "While in London, Adams published a work entitled A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States (1787). In it he repudiated the views of Turgot and other European writers as to the viciousness of the framework of state governments. Turgot argued that countries that lacked aristocracies needn't have bicameral legislatures.  He thought that  republican governments feature “all authorities into one center, that of the nation.” Turgot to Richard Price, March 22, 1778, in Works of John Adams, IV:279  In the book, Adams suggested that \"the rich, the well-born and the able\" should be set apart from other men in a senate--that would prevent them from dominating the lower house.  Wood (2006) has maintained that Adams had become intellectually irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a decade of vigorous and searching debate as well as shaping experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical conception of politics which understood government as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new conception of popular sovereignty now saw the people-at-large as the sole possessors of power in the realm.  All agents of the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited period of time. Adams had completely missed this concept and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics. Wood, Revolutionary Characters: What Made the Founders Different (2006) pp 173-202; see also Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (1993).   Yet Wood overlooks Adams' peculiar definition of the term \"republic,\" and his support for a constitution ratified by the people. Thompson,1999  He also underplays Adams' belief in checks and balances. \"Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest,” Adams wrote.

He played a minor role in the politics of the early 1790s and was reelected in 1792. Washington never asked Adams for input on policy and legal issues.  Ferling (1992) ch 15\n",

Most Vice Presidents after him were not regarded as powerful or significant members of Presidential administrations, with some exceptions (such as Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, Walter Mondale, Al Gore or Dick Cheney, who were regarded as influential members of their President's teams).\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first year of Washington's administration, Adams became deeply involved in a month-long Senate controversy over what the official title of the President would be, favoring grandiose titles such as \"His Majesty the President\" or \"His High Mightiness\" over the simple \"President of the United States\" that won the issue. The pomposity of Adams's stance, and his being overweight, led to the nickname \"His Rotundity.\"\n",

      "As president of the Senate, Adams cast 31 tie-breaking votes—a record that only John C. Calhoun came close to tying, with 28.  Ferling (1992) p 311  His votes protected the president's sole authority over the removal of appointees and influenced the location of the national capital. On at least one occasion, he persuaded senators to vote against legislation that he opposed, and he frequently lectured the Senate on procedural and policy matters. Adams's political views and his active role in the Senate made him a natural target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, as a result of a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters, he began to exercise more restraint.  When the two political parties formed, he joined the Federalist Party, but never got on well with its dominant leader Alexander Hamilton. Because of Adams's seniority and the need for a northern president, he was elected as the Federalist  nominee for president in 1796, over Thomas Jefferson, the leader of the opposition Democratic-Republican Party. His success was due to peace and prosperity; Washington and Hamilton had averted war with Britain by the Jay Treaty of 1795.  Ferling (1992) pp 316-32\n",

The federalists wanted Adams as their presidential candidate to crush Thomas Jefferson's bid. Most federalists would have preferred Hamilton to be a candidate.  Although Hamilton and his followers supported Adams, they also held a grudge against him.  They did consider him to be the lesser of the two evils. However, they thought Adams lacked the seriousness and popularity that had caused Washington to be successful, and also feared that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable, and stubborn to follow their directions.  Adams' opponents were former Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, who was joined by Senator Aaron Burr of New York on the Democratic-Republican ticket.\n",

Some historians consider his worst mistake to be keeping the old cabinet, which was controlled by Hamilton, instead of installing his own people, confirming Adams's own admission he was a poor politician because he \"was unpractised in intrigues for power.\"  Ferling (1992) ch 16, p 333.  Yet, there are those historians who feel that Adams retention of Washington's cabinet was a statesman-like step to soothe worries about an orderly succession.

      "Adams's four years as president (1797 1801) were marked by intense disputes over foreign policy. Britain and France were at war; Adams and the Federalists favored Britain, while Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans favored France. An undeclared naval war between the U.S. and France, called the Quasi-War, broke out in 1798. The humiliation of the XYZ Affair, in which the French demanded huge bribes before any discussions could begin, led to serious threats of full-scale war with France and embarrassed the Jeffersonians, who were friends to France. The Federalists built up the army under George Washington and Alexander Hamilton, built warships, such as the USS Constitution, and raised taxes. They cracked down on political immigrants and domestic opponents with the Alien and Sedition Acts, which were signed by Adams in 1798.\n",
      "\n",
      "These Acts were composed of four separate and distinct units:\n",

      "These 4 acts were brought about to suppress Republican opposition. The Naturalization Act doubled the period required to naturalize the foreign born to American citizenship to 14 years. Since most immigrants voted republican they thought by initiating this act it would decrease the proportion of people who voted republican. \n",
      "The Alien Friends Act and the Alien Enemies Act allowed the president to deport any foreigner that he  thought was dangerous to the country. \n",
      "The Sedition Act criminalized anyone who publicly criticized the federal government. Some of the punishments included 2-5 years in prison and fines of $2,000 to $5,000. Adams had not designed or promoted any of these acts but he did sign them into law because he had no problem punishing those who abused the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those Acts, and the high-profile prosecution of a number of newspaper editors and one Congressman by the Federalists, became highly controversial. Some historians have noted that the Alien and Sedition Acts were relatively rarely enforced, as only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified and as Adams never signed a deportation order, and that the furor over the Alien and Sedition Acts was mainly stirred up by the Democratic-Republicans. However, other historians emphasize that the Acts were highly controversial from the outset, resulted in many aliens leaving the country voluntarily, and created an atmosphere where opposing the Federalists, even on the floor of Congress, could and did result in prosecution. The election of 1800 became a bitter and volatile battle, with each side expressing extraordinary fear of the other party and its policies.  Ferling (1992) ch 17\n",

      "The deep division in the Federalist party came on the army issue. Adams was forced to name Washington as commander of the new army, and Washington demanded that Hamilton be given the second position. Adams reluctantly gave in. Major General Hamilton virtually took control of the War department. The rift between Adams and the High Federalists (as Adams's opponents were called) grew wider. The High Federalists refused to consult Adams over the key legislation of 1798; they changed the defense measures which he had called for, demanded that Hamilton control the army, and refused to recognize the necessity of giving key Democratic-Republicans (like Aaron Burr) senior positions in the army (which Adams wanted to do in order to gain some Democratic-Republican support). By building a large standing army the High Federalists raised popular alarms and played into the hands of the Democratic-Republicans. They also alienated Adams and his large personal following. They shortsightedly viewed the Federalist party as their own tool and ignored the need to pull together the entire nation in the face of war with France. Kurtz (1967) yyoaoaoaschwing! p 331\n",

      "For long stretches, Adams withdrew to his home in Massachusetts. In February 1799, Adams stunned the country by sending diplomat William Vans Murray on a peace mission to France. Napoleon, realizing the animosity of the United States was doing no good, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. The Treaty of Alliance of 1778 was superseded and the United States could now be free of foreign entanglements, as Washington advised in his own Farewell Letter. Adams avoided war, but deeply split his own party in the process. He brought in John Marshall as Secretary of State and demobilized the emergency army.  Ferling (1992) ch 18\n",

      "The death of Washington, in 1799, weakened the Federalists, as they lost the one man who symbolized and united the party.  In the presidential election of 1800, Adams ran and lost the electoral vote narrowly. Among the causes of his defeat was distrust of him by \"High Federalists\" led by Hamilton, the popular disapproval of the Alien and Sedition Acts, the popularity of his opponent, Thomas Jefferson, and the effective politicking of Aaron Burr in New York State, where the legislature (which selected the electoral college) shifted from Federalist to Republican on the basis of a few wards in New York City controlled by Burr's machine.

      "In the election of 1800 John Adams and his running mate, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney went against the Republican duo of Jefferson and Burr. Hamilton tried his hardest to sabotage Adams campaign in hopes of boosting Pinckney's chances of winning the presidency. In the end, Adams lost narrowly to Jefferson by 65 to 73 electoral votes.\n",

      "As his term was expiring, Adams appointed a series of judges, called the \"Midnight Judges\" because most of them were formally appointed days before the presidential term expired. Most of the judges were eventually unseated when the Jeffersonians abolished their offices. But John Marshall remained, and his long tenure as Chief Justice of the United States represents the most lasting influence of the Federalists, as Marshall refashioned the Constitution into a nationalizing force and established the Judicial Branch as the equal of the Executive and Legislative branches.

      "In 1812, Adams reconciled with Jefferson. Their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, who had been corresponding with both, encouraged Adams to reach out to Jefferson. Adams sent a brief note to Jefferson, which resulted in a resumption of their friendship, and initiated a correspondence which lasted the rest of their lives. Their letters are rich in insight into both the period and the minds of the two Presidents and revolutionary leaders. Their correspondence lasted fourteen years, and consisted of 158 letters.  Cappon (1988)   It was in these years that they two men discussed \"natural aristocracy.\"  Jefferson said that \"“The natural aristocracy I consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society.  And indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural aristoi into the offices of government?\" Cappon, ed., 387  Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, \"Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded.  Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. . . . When aristocracies, are established by human laws and honour wealth and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence.\"  Cappon, ed. 400   It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue.  That being the way of nature, he thought such \"talents\" were natural.  A good government, therefore, had to account for that reality.\n",

      "On July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, Adams died at his home in Quincy. His last words are often quoted as \"Thomas Jefferson survives.\" Only the words \"Thomas Jefferson\" were clearly intelligible among his last, however.  Jefferson Still Survives. Retrieved on 2006-12-26.  Adams was unaware that Jefferson, his great political rival — and later friend and correspondent — had died a few hours earlier on that same day.United First Parish Church The fact that Adams and Jefferson, both of whom had been so instrumental in creating the Declaration of Independence, died on the fiftieth anniversary of the date of its publication, is one of the more remarkable coincidences in history.\n",

      "Adams was raised a Congregationalist, becoming a Unitarian at a time when most of the Congregational churches around Boston were turning to Unitarianism.  Everett (1966) argues that Adams was not a deist, but he used deistic terms in his speeches and writing. He believed in the essential goodness of the creation, but did not believe in the divinity of Christ or that God intervened in the affairs of individuals. Although not anti-clerical, he advocated the separation of church and state. He also believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense. Everett concludes that \"Adams strove for a religion based on a common sense sort of reasonableness\" and maintained that religion must change and evolve toward perfection. Robert B. Everett, \"The Mature Religious Thought of John Adams,\" Proceedings of the South Carolina Historical Association (1966), p 49-57; [ISSN 0361-6207].\n",
      "\n",
      "Adams often railed against what he saw as overclaiming of authority by the Catholic church. See  TeachingAmericanHistory.org: \" A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law\", John Adams, 1765\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1796, Adams denounced the deism of political opponent Thomas Paine, saying, \"The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will.\" The Works of John Adams (1854), vol III, p 421, diary entry for July 26, 1796.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Unitarian Universalist Historical Society sheds some light on Adams’s religious beliefs.    They point out that Adams was clearly no atheist by quoting from his letter to Benjamin Rush, an early promoter of Universalist thought, “I have attended public worship in all countries and with all sects and believe them all much better than no religion, though I have not thought myself obliged to believe all I heard.” The Society also relates how Rush reconciled Adams to his former friend Thomas Jefferson in 1812, after many bitter political battles. This resulted in correspondence between Adams and Jefferson about many topics, including philosophy and religion.  In one of these communications, Adams told Jefferson, \"The Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount contain my religion.\" In another letter, Adams reveals his sincere devotion to God, “My Adoration of the Author of the Universe is too profound and too sincere. The Love of God and his Creation; delight, Joy, Tryumph, Exaltation in my own existence, tho' but an Atom, a molecule Organique, in the Universe, are my religion.” He continues by revealing his Universalist sympathies, rejection of orthodox Christian dogma, and his personal belief that he was a true Christian for not accepting such dogma, “Howl, Snarl, bite, Ye Calvinistick! Ye Athanasian Divines, if You will. Ye will say, I am no Christian: I say Ye are no Christians: and there the Account is ballanced. Yet I believe all the honest men among you, are Christians in my Sense of the Word.\" The Society also demonstrates that Adams rejected orthodox Christian doctrines of the trinity, predestination, yet equated human understanding and the human conscience to “celestial communication” or personal revelation from God. It is also shown that Adams held a strong conviction in life after death or otherwise, as he explained, “you might be ashamed of your Maker.”\n"

This method allows for a deep semantic understanding between the query and the documents, enabling the model to capture nuanced relationships that keyword-based methods might miss. In the results, the top-ranked document scored a high 9.1589 and directly addressed the query by detailing John Adams's marriage to Abigail Smith. The second and third documents, with scores of 3.8088 and 0.7726 respectively, were less relevant but still related to his family.\n",
    "\n",
    "The QA_Generator produced the answer \"John Adams was married to Abigail Smith,\" demonstrating that the model effectively utilized the most relevant context. The high score of the top document indicates that the cross-encoder successfully identified the most pertinent information. This level of precision is ideal for systems where accuracy is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the computational intensity of encoding each query-document pair poses significant challenges for system design. The Cross-Encoder-Only strategy requires substantial processing power, which can lead to increased latency, especially when dealing with large corpora or high volumes of queries. This necessitates the allocation of robust computational resources, such as GPUs or distributed computing clusters, to maintain acceptable response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can infer the computational intensity of this strategy based on the nature of cross-encoder models. Cross-encoders perform pairwise encoding of the query and each document, passing them through a transformer-based neural network to compute similarity scores. This process is computationally expensive because it scales linearly with the number of documents in the corpus. Each query-document pair requires substantial processing, often involving large numbers of parameters and multiple layers in the neural network. This understanding comes from the well-known properties of transformer models, which are resource-intensive due to their self-attention mechanisms and deep architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational demands of the Cross-Encoder-Only strategy pose significant challenges for system design. The necessity to process each query-document pair individually leads to increased latency, especially when dealing with large corpora or high query volumes. This necessitates the allocation of robust computational resources, such as GPUs or distributed computing clusters, to maintain acceptable response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating this strategy into a system design means prioritizing accuracy over scalability. For applications where precise answers are essential, such as legal research or medical information retrieval, the investment in computational resources may be justified. System design decisions might consider implementing efficient parallel processing and optimizing code to handle the computational load. Additionally, caching mechanisms for frequent queries can mitigate some performance issues by reusing computed embeddings. Understanding the trade-offs between computational intensity and accuracy is crucial, and this knowledge is derived from theoretical insights into the algorithmic complexity of cross-encoder models."

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF-Only strategy relies on term frequency-inverse document frequency to rank documents based on keyword occurrences. This method is computationally efficient and easy to implement but lacks semantic understanding. In the results, the top-ranked document had a score of 0.8150 and was about the \"Presidential Dollar of John Adams,\" which is not directly relevant to the query about his marriage. The second and third documents were more relevant but were not ranked first due to the limitations of TF-IDF in capturing context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the initial misranking, the QA_Generator still provided the correct answer, \"John Adams was married to Abigail Smith,\" because multiple top documents were used as context. This highlights the importance of including several top-ranked documents when the ranking strategy may not reliably place the most relevant document first. The TF-IDF-Only strategy's efficiency allows for the processing of larger batches of documents without significant performance degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that TF-IDF computations are computationally lightweight because they involve simple mathematical operations: counting term frequencies and calculating inverse document frequencies. These operations are linear with respect to the number of documents and can be efficiently executed using optimized libraries. The absence of complex model parameters or iterative training processes contributes to the strategy's speed and low computational intensity. This understanding is based on the theoretical properties of TF-IDF algorithms, which have been extensively studied and applied in information retrieval systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a system design perspective, the TF-IDF-Only strategy is advantageous for systems with limited computational resources or where rapid response times are crucial. Its simplicity reduces implementation complexity and maintenance overhead. However, the trade-off is reduced accuracy in the initial ranking, which can affect the quality of the generated answers if not mitigated by including more context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve performance while maintaining efficiency, system designers might consider combining TF-IDF with other strategies or enhancing it with techniques like n-gram analysis or synonym expansion. This can help the model capture more contextually relevant documents without significantly increasing computational demands. The knowledge that these enhancements add minimal computational overhead comes from the understanding that they are extensions of the basic TF-IDF calculations, still relying on straightforward mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, systems employing TF-IDF should be designed to pass multiple top documents to the answer generator to compensate for potential misrankings. This approach leverages the efficiency of TF-IDF while addressing its limitations in capturing semantic nuances."

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hybrid Strategy merges the strengths of both the cross-encoder and TF-IDF approaches by combining their scores to rank documents. This method aims to balance the semantic understanding of the cross-encoder with the efficiency of TF-IDF. In the results, the top-ranked document scored 6.7050 and was the same highly relevant document identified by the cross-encoder alone. The second and third documents also mirrored those from the cross-encoder results but with adjusted scores due to the combined ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The QA_Generator again produced the accurate answer, \"John Adams was married to Abigail Smith.\" This consistency in answer quality indicates that the Hybrid Strategy effectively identifies relevant documents while potentially reducing computational costs compared to the cross-encoder alone. By incorporating TF-IDF scores, the hybrid model can prioritize documents that are both semantically relevant and contain key terms from the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We infer that the computational intensity of the Hybrid Strategy is moderate. While it still uses the resource-intensive cross-encoder, it can limit the number of documents processed by prioritizing those with high TF-IDF scores. The combination of scores allows for an initial filtering that reduces the total number of expensive computations. This understanding is based on the theoretical principle that combining a fast, efficient method (TF-IDF) with a slower, more accurate method (cross-encoder) can optimize overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of system design, the Hybrid Strategy requires careful implementation to ensure that the integration of the two models is seamless. Adjusting the weights assigned to each model's scores is crucial for optimal performance and may require empirical tuning based on the specific corpus and query types. This strategy demands moderate computational resources, making it more scalable than the Cross-Encoder-Only approach but more resource-intensive than TF-IDF alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "System design decisions must consider the added complexity of maintaining and updating two models within the system. Monitoring and logging become essential to diagnose performance issues or adjust weighting parameters. The Hybrid Strategy is suitable for applications where both accuracy and efficiency are important, as it offers a compromise that can meet user expectations without overwhelming system resources."

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sequential Re-rank Strategy begins by employing TF-IDF to quickly filter the corpus, selecting the top-ranked documents based on lexical similarity to the query. These top documents are then passed to the cross-encoder for refined re-ranking based on semantic similarity. This approach aims to reduce computational load by limiting the number of documents that require the resource-intensive processing of the cross-encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the results, the top document had a high score of 9.1589 and directly addressed the query by detailing John Adams's marriage to Abigail Smith. The second document, with a score of 3.8088, discussed his daughter Abigail (\"Nabby\") and her marriage, which is related but not directly answering the query about John Adams's spouse. The third document, however, had a negative score of -3.7158 and was about John Adams's political career, mentioning nothing about his marriage. This document made it through the initial TF-IDF filtering into the cross-encoder stage, despite its lack of relevance to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation highlights a significant downside of the Sequential Re-rank Strategy: the reliance on TF-IDF for initial filtering can result in both including irrelevant documents and excluding relevant ones. TF-IDF scores are based on lexical similarity, focusing on the frequency of shared terms between the query and the documents. In this case, the third-ranked document likely contained common terms like \"John Adams\" and \"president,\" which boosted its TF-IDF score despite its irrelevance to the query about his marriage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, semantically relevant documents that do not share exact terms with the query may be assigned low TF-IDF scores and thus be excluded from the cross-encoder re-ranking. For example, a document that refers to John Adams's wife using phrases like \"his lifelong partner\" or \"the mother of his children\" without explicitly mentioning \"married\" or \"Abigail Smith\" might be overlooked. This means that the Sequential Re-rank Strategy can miss important documents that are crucial for generating accurate answers, simply because they do not contain the specific keywords used in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the inclusion of an irrelevant document in the top results, the QA_Generator still managed to produce the correct answer, \"John Adams was married to Abigail Smith,\" by utilizing the most relevant document. However, relying on chance that the top TF-IDF documents include the necessary information is not a robust strategy, especially in larger corpora where the proportion of irrelevant documents is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "This limitation affects the overall effectiveness of the system, particularly in scenarios where accurate and comprehensive information retrieval is critical. The reliance on lexical similarity for initial filtering introduces a trade-off between efficiency and the completeness of relevant information retrieval. The system may inadvertently filter out documents that are semantically relevant but lexically different, thereby undermining the quality of the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, system design decisions must consider enhancing the initial filtering mechanism. One approach is to incorporate semantic search methods, such as using dense vector embeddings from models like Sentence-BERT, in conjunction with TF-IDF scores. This combination can help capture documents that are semantically related to the query, even if they lack keyword overlap. Another strategy is to increase the number of top documents selected by TF-IDF for cross-encoder re-ranking, thereby reducing the likelihood of excluding relevant information. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational load on the cross-encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting the weighting between TF-IDF and cross-encoder scores, as seen in the Hybrid Strategy, may also alleviate some of these issues by allowing both lexical and semantic similarities to influence the final ranking. While the Sequential Re-rank Strategy offers notable computational efficiency by limiting cross-encoder processing to a subset of documents, its reliance on TF-IDF for initial filtering can result in both including irrelevant documents and excluding semantically relevant ones. This limitation can compromise the accuracy and reliability of the system, especially in larger datasets where the diversity of language and terminology is greater. System design decisions must carefully evaluate and potentially enhance the initial filtering process to balance efficiency with the need for precise and comprehensive answers. By integrating semantic search techniques and adjusting system parameters, it is possible to mitigate these downsides and improve the overall performance of the question-answering system."

    "Applying TF-IDF on the full corpus without prior filtering tests the strategy's standalone effectiveness. In the results, the top-ranked document again was about the \"Presidential Dollar of John Adams,\" which is not directly relevant to the query. The relevant document detailing his marriage was ranked second with a score of 0.1710. Despite the misranking, the QA_Generator produced the correct answer by utilizing multiple top documents as context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy demonstrates the limitations of TF-IDF when dealing with large corpora, as it may not sufficiently prioritize the most relevant documents. The efficiency of processing the full corpus is high due to the simplicity of TF-IDF calculations, but the lack of semantic understanding can hinder answer accuracy if not compensated by additional context.\n",

The efficiency of processing the full corpus is high due to the simplicity of TF-IDF calculations, but the lack of semantic understanding can hinder answer accuracy if not compensated by additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that TF-IDF remains computationally efficient even on large datasets because the calculations are linear and can be executed using optimized data structures and algorithms. The lack of semantic depth is a known limitation of TF-IDF, as it does not capture the meaning of words beyond their statistical occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a system design perspective, relying solely on TF-IDF across a full corpus is suitable for systems where computational resources are minimal, and response times must be extremely fast. However, the potential impact on answer quality necessitates additional considerations. Designers might need to implement mechanisms to include more documents in the context or integrate supplementary methods to enhance relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy is less suitable for applications where precise answers are critical. It may be appropriate for preliminary data exploration or systems where users are expected to refine queries iteratively. Understanding the trade-offs between speed and accuracy is essential, and this knowledge comes from theoretical insights into information retrieval practices. To improve performance, system design decisions could consider incorporating lightweight semantic models or heuristic rules to boost relevant documents in the ranking. By integrating these enhancements, systems can achieve a better balance between efficiency and accuracy, ensuring that users receive more relevant answers without incurring significant additional computational costs. This approach enables the system to maintain high responsiveness while providing improved information retrieval, making it more effective across a wider range of applications."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of these five re-ranking strategies reveals how theoretical knowledge of computational complexity and algorithmic behavior informs our understanding of their impact on system design. The Cross-Encoder-Only Strategy offers high precision but at the cost of significant computational resources, known from the resource demands of neural network models. The TF-IDF-Only and TF-IDF on Full Corpus strategies are efficient due to their simple mathematical operations but risk misranking relevant documents due to their inability to capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hybrid and Sequential Re-rank strategies provide a middle ground, balancing resource use with acceptable accuracy levels. However, the Hybrid strategy may be better than the Sequential Re-rank strategy in selecting semantically relevant documents. By combining TF-IDF and cross-encoder scores for each document, the Hybrid strategy allows both lexical and semantic similarities to influence the final ranking. This approach mitigates the risk of excluding important documents that may not be highly ranked by TF-IDF alone but are semantically relevant to the query. In contrast, the Sequential Re-rank strategy relies on TF-IDF for initial filtering, which can result in both including irrelevant documents and excluding semantically relevant ones, as it only passes the top lexical matches to the cross-encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our understanding of the computational intensity and efficiency of these strategies is based on combining the known properties of their constituent methods. The Hybrid strategy, while slightly more computationally intensive than the Sequential Re-rank strategy, offers improved accuracy by ensuring that semantically relevant documents are more likely to be included in the final ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "System design decisions must align the choice of strategy with the application's requirements, considering factors such as resource availability, expected query volume, and the criticality of precise answers. Incorporating multiple top-ranked documents into the context for the QA_Generator enhances the likelihood of producing accurate answers, particularly when the ranking strategy may not consistently place the most relevant document first. By integrating theoretical insights into computational intensity, speed, and scalability with empirical observations of model performance, we can make informed decisions that balance efficiency and accuracy in question-answering systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the inherent characteristics of each strategy allows us to predict their impact on system design, even without direct measurement of computational metrics. Recognizing that the Hybrid strategy may better capture semantically relevant documents highlights the importance of selecting a re-ranking approach that aligns with the system's goals. Ultimately, choosing the appropriate strategy involves balancing the trade-offs between computational resources and the need for accurate, reliable information retrieval."
