    "- Out of the three models, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Extra Trees, I selected Random Forest to be the inference model due to its superior performance across the most common classification metrics.\n",
    "- Random Forest exhibited the best balance between precision, recall, and overall accuracy, making it a reliable choice.\n",
    "- It achieved an overall accuracy of 99.76%, surpassing both Logistic Regression (89.36%) and Extra Trees (99.68%).\n",
    "- While Extra Trees also performed well in terms of accuracy, Random Forest did better in handling the class imbalance in fraud detection.\n",
    "- Fraudulent transactions are rarer than legitimate ones, making it challenging for models to accurately predict fraud without producing many false positives.\n",
    "- Random Forest handled this challenge well, as demonstrated by its strong performance in detecting fraudulent cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regarding recall, Random Forest identified 52% of fraudulent transactions, which is a significant improvement over Extra Trees, which only caught 29%.\n",
    "- While Logistic Regression had a higher recall of 73%, it suffered from low precision of 0.03, meaning it predicted a large number of false positives, flagging a large proportion of transactions as fraudulent.\n",
    "- Random Forest, on the other hand, balanced these metrics effectively, with a precision of 0.90 for fraud cases and an F1-score of 0.66.\n",
    "- This balance between precision and recall is crucial for SecureBank’s fraud detection, as it reduces false positives while still identifying a significant portion of actual fraud cases.\n",
    "- Too many false positives can be inconvenient for customers and create extra work for investigators, while too few true positives can go on to cause significant harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In comparison, Extra Trees struggled with recall, identifying less than one-third of fraud cases, and while its precision was high at 0.95, its lower recall resulted in a significantly lower F1-score of 0.44.\n",
    "- This means that Extra Trees, while accurate in its predictions when it did identify fraud, missed a large number of fraudulent transactions, making it less effective in practice.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression, while able to catch more fraud cases, did so at the cost of falsely flagging many legitimate transactions, as indicated by its low F1-score of 0.06.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Looking at the confusion matrix, Random Forest showed that it minimized both false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "- It identified 543 out of 1,045 fraud cases while only producing 58 false positives.\n",
    "- Although this could be far better, this level of performance is crucial in the context of fraud detection, where false positives can result in customer dissatisfaction and unnecessary interventions, while false negatives can lead to undetected fraudulent activity.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression, by contrast, produced an alarming 24,958 false positives, which would severely disrupt legitimate transactions.\n",
    "- Extra Trees had fewer false positives but struggled with 743 false negatives, meaning it missed a large number of fraud cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An additional point in favor of Random Forest is its training speed and computational efficiency.\n",
    "- While SVM was initially considered as an alternative model, its training time was prohibitively long due to the large dataset and the non-linear kernel it was using by default.\n",
    "- In contrast, Random Forest was significantly faster to train and evaluate, making it the most practical model for real-time fraud detection.\n",
    "- The faster runtime is especially important in environments where models need to be updated frequently or when large-scale data processing is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In conclusion, Random Forest emerged as the strongest model based on its ability to handle class imbalance, its high accuracy, and its balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "- It offers the best trade-off between detecting fraud and minimizing false positives, making it the most reliable and robust model for deployment out of the three evaluated models.\n",
    "- Therefore, Random Forest is the optimal choice for the inference pipeline, ensuring both efficiency and effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions."
